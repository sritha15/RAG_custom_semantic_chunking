            "Highlights HIGHLIGHTS Environmental Effects Assessment Panel 2022 Quadrennial Assessment Environmental effects of stratospheric ozone depletion, UV radiation, and interactions with climate change The highlights of the 2022 Quadrennial Assessment focus on major findings since the last assessment, acknowledging the contribution of the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer to several of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and the alignment of the Panel with these Goals. The strong interconnected effects of stratospheric ozone depletion, ultraviolet (UV) radiation, and climate change are increasingly evident and complex, with consequences for life on Earth and a sustainable future. Within this context, the Highlights cover current and projected consequences for human health (including the COVID-19 pandemic), terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, air quality, natural and synthetic materials, and microplastics. 1 Ultraviolet radiation, stratospheric ozone depletion, and climate change • Concentrations of stratospheric ozone in the future will depend on the decrease in ozone-depleting substances (ODSs) controlled by the Montreal Protocol, other substances currently not controlled, and on emissions of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide. The trajectory of these emissions depends greatly on policy decisions. • Large increases in UV radiation were observed during the 2020 Antarctic and Arctic springs, when the UV Index rose by to 80% and 70%, respectively, above the historical means. • In the Antarctic, these anomalously high amounts of UV radiation extended over spring and the start of summer, and may have had negative consequences for migrating animals returning to breed, which may not have been adapted to the unusually high UV irradiation. • Increasing warming will lead to more ice melt and increased exposure of ecosystems to UV radiation on land and in water bodies, especially in polar and high-elevation regions. • Thawing of permafrosts will result in the release of UV-absorbing organic carbon into aquatic ecosystems and enhanced emissions of carbon dioxide and methane to the atmosphere. • The concurrence of heat waves with drought and high UV-B irradiance (280-315 nm) may negatively affect food security and biodiversity of crops and animals. These climatic conditions can disrupt formerly favourable habitats and may shift habitats to locations with different conditions, to which plants and animals may not be adapt. Tropical coral reefs under naturally high UV irradiance are of particular concern, since an increase in sea surface temperatures of 1 °C to 2 °C can cause bleaching of corals, enhanced by high amounts of UV radiation. 2 Human health • Exposure to UV radiation has multiple harms and benefits. Harms include skin cancer, inflammatory skin disorders, sunburn, and eye disorders such as cataract. Benefits include production of vitamin D, reduced autoimmune disease and, possibly, lowered blood pressure and decreased risk of metabolic disorders. • The Montreal Protocol has resulted in significant reductions in UV-related diseases. The United States Environmental Protection Agency has estimated that, due to the Montreal Protocol, 11 million cases of melanoma, 432 million cases of keratinocyte skin cancers, and 63 million cases of cataract will have been avoided for those born between 1890 and 2100 in the United States. 4\n",
            "\n",
            "Highlights • The Montreal Protocol may have benefits for UV-induced inflammatory skin disorders. In some people these lead to large decreases in quality of life. Many diuretic and anti-inflammatory drugs can cause photosensitivity when skin is exposed to UV radiation, although the global incidence of drug-induced photosensitivity is unclear. Some drugs used for decreasing blood pressure may increase the risk of keratinocyte skin cancer through UV-induced DNA damage. • By avoiding large increases in the UV Index, the Montreal Protocol may have enabled people, especially those with light skin, to spend time outdoors without incurring sunburn, thereby gaining the benefits of sun exposure. One of these benefits is the generation of vitamin D in the skin. Vitamin D plays an important role in maintaining musculoskeletal health, and there is increasing evidence of benefits for diseases related to immune function, including autoimmune diseases (e.g., multiple sclerosis), infection, and for cardiovascular disease, cancer mortality, and all-cause mortality. • Decreases in UV radiation under the Montreal Protocol may have resulted in a lower rate at which pathogens are inactivated, including the SARS-CoV-2 virus responsible for COVID-19. However, the positive outcomes of the Montreal Protocol outweigh any potential advantage for disinfection by higher amounts of solar UV radiation. 3 Role of UV radiation in the troposphere • Outdoor air pollution (e.g., from sulfate, nitrate, ozone, and particulate matter) results in ca 4 million premature deaths per year, and also damages vegetation and crops. • Increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases are partly responsible for enhanced atmospheric circulation resulting in a downward transport of additional ozone (‘good’ UV-B-absorbing ozone) from the stratosphere to the troposphere (‘bad’ ozone, part of smog). • In the troposphere (the layer of the atmosphere extending from the Earth’s surface to a height of 8-15 km), UV-B radiation generates the cleaning agent of the atmosphere, the hydroxyl radical (OH). This radical removes many compounds released by human activity and natural sources, such as carbon monoxide, methane, and HFOs, HFCs and HCFCs1 (widely used as refrigerants). HFCs and HCFCs have high global warming potential contributing to climate change. When broken down by hydroxyl radicals, these compounds can form halogenated chemicals, including trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). • TFA has a long environmental lifetime, accumulates in surface and ground waters, and has been found in blood, drinking water, beverages, dust, plants, and agricultural soils. However, it does not interact with biological molecules and, due to its high solubility in water, it does not bioaccumulate. It is unlikely to cause adverse effects in terrestrial and aquatic organisms. Continued monitoring and assessment are nevertheless advised due to uncertainties in the deposition of TFA and its potential effects on marine organisms. • UV radiation also plays a key role in creating harmful photochemical smog by reacting with pollutants such as nitrogen oxides, and volatile organic compounds (e.g., fuel, solvent vapours) mostly from industry and transport. Even low concentrations of pollutants are detrimental to human health, prompting the World Health Organization to recommend average annual decreases in key air pollutants, including halving the maximum current level (10 µg/m3) of small particulate matter to 5 µg/m3, and that of nitrogen dioxide from 40 to 10 µg/m3. 4 Global challenges of increasing plastic debris in the environment • Many materials, including plastics, are susceptible to solar UV radiation, high temperature, and moisture, resulting in degradation, loss in strength, discolouration, decreased service life and environmental pollution due to the release of potentially environmentally harmful by-products. UV-stabilisers and other additives are being used to counteract photodegradation and release of toxic byproducts. • UV-degradation of plastics leads to generation of microplastics (<5 mm) and nanoplastics (<0.001 mm), which have been found in ecosystems, bottled drinking water, table salt, seafood, and wastewater. Microfibres, including textile fibre fragments, are common contaminants of the environment. However, the biological effects of microand nanoplastics remain uncertain. • New UV-stabilisation technologies that block UV radiation through treatment of textiles with certain oxide nanoparticles (e.g., zinc oxide, titanium oxide), are being developed for next-generation synthetic (e.g., polyester fabric) and natural textiles (e.g. cotton fabric). A sustainable future requires continued adherence to the Montreal Protocol, with particular attention paid to mitigation of climate change, since recovery of stratospheric ozone is highly dependent on changes in greenhouse gas emissions and atmospheric concentrations of ozone-depleting substances, which will also determine future UV radiation at the Earth’s surface. 1 ODS replacements: HFCs, hydrofluorocarbons; HCFCs, hydrochlorofluorocarbons; HFOs, hydrofluoroolefins. 5\n",

            "Preface PREFACE Background The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer was established 35 years ago following the 1985 Vienna Convention for protection of the environment and human health against excessive amounts of harmful ultraviolet-B (UV-B, 280-315 nm) radiation reaching the Earth’s surface due to a reduced UV-B-absorbing ozone layer. The Montreal Protocol, ratified globally by all 198 Parties (countries), controls ca 100 ozone-depleting substances (ODS). These substances have been used in many applications, such as in refrigerants, air conditioners, aerosol propellants, fumigants against pests, fire extinguishers, and foam materials. The Montreal Protocol has phased out nearly 99% of ODS, including ODS with high global warming potentials such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFC), thus serving a dual purpose. However, some of the replacements for ODS also have high global warming potentials, for example, the hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). Several of these replacements have been added to the substances controlled by the Montreal Protocol. The HFCs are now being phased down under the Kigali Amendment. As of December 2022, 145 countries have signed the Kigali Amendment, exemplifying key additional outcomes of the Montreal Protocol, namely, that of also curbing climate warming and stimulating innovations to increase energy efficiency of cooling equipment used industrially as well as domestically. As the concentrations of ODS decline in the upper atmosphere, the stratospheric ozone layer is projected to recover to pre-1980 levels by the middle of the 21st century, assuming full compliance with the control measures of the Montreal Protocol. However, in the coming decades, the ozone layer will be increasingly influenced by emissions of greenhouse gases and ensuing global warming. These trends are highly likely to modify the amount of UV radiation reaching the Earth's surface with implications for the effects on ecosystems and human health. Role of the Assessment Panels Against this background, four Panels of experts were established in 1988 to support and advise the Parties to the Montreal Protocol with up-to-date information to facilitate decisions for protecting the stratospheric ozone layer. In 1990 the four Panels were consolidated into three, the Scientific Assessment Panel, the Environmental Effects Assessment Panel, and the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel. Every four years, each of the Panels provides their Quadrennial Assessments as well as a Synthesis Report that summarises the key findings of all the Panels. In the in-between years leading up to the quadrennial, the Panels continue to inform the Parties to the Montreal Protocol of new scientific information. The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel (EEAP) evaluates the consequences of stratospheric ozone depletion in the context of a changing global climate in line with its Terms of Reference (decision XXXI/2, November 2019) and within the framework of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The EEAP also alerts the Parties to additional areas of potential importance to the Montreal Protocol. The 2022 Quadrennial Assessment focusses on the following: Interactive effects of stratospheric ozone and climate change on: 1. Solar ultraviolet radiation 2. Human health 3. COVID-19 and the Montreal Protocol 4. Terrestrial ecosystems and biogeochemical cycles 5. Aquatic ecosystems 6. Composition of the troposphere and air quality 7. Natural and synthetic materials 8. Microplastics in the environment 6\n",

The Assessment includes Highlights, Executive Summary, contribution to the above topics, and a Question & Answer (Q&A) document. Particular attention is given to the linkages between stratospheric ozone depletion and UV radiation, and climate change, with respect to the broad effects on the environment and human health. Key areas of concern are the increased frequency and intensity of extreme climate events that are occurring together with the ongoing increases in emissions of greenhouse gases and consequent rising temperatures in many parts of the world. These changes also change the exposure to UV radiation of humans, other animals, and ecosystems, with implications for human well-being, food security, biodiversity, and overall sustainability of life on our planet.

This global treaty, including the Kigali Amendment, has also been one of the most important societal actions taken to date to mitigate global warming, since many of the ozone-depleting substances (ODS) and their substitutes that are controlled by the Montreal Protocol are also potent greenhouse gases (GHGs) [3-5]. The Antarctic ozone hole is contributing to climate change in the Southern Hemisphere, and climate change is modifying the exposure of humans, other animals, plants, and materials to UV-B and UV-A radiation (315-400 nm) [6,7]. Thus, changes in stratospheric ozone, UV radiation, and climate are inextricably linked in a number of ways that have the potential to affect human health and the environment. In this Executive Summary we highlight and summarise key findings from the 2022 Quadrennial Assessment by the Environmental Effects Assessment Panel (EEAP; Box 1) of the Montreal Protocol under the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). The 2022 Qudrennial Assessment presents the most recent, comprehensive assessment since the 2018 Quadrennial Assessment (available at and also for the wider scientific community in Photochemical & Photobiological Sciences 18, 595-828). The current assessment addresses the interactive environmental effects of changes in the stratospheric ozone layer, solar UV radiation, and climate on human health, terrestrial, and aquatic ecosystems, biogeochemical cycles, air quality, materials, and microplastics in accordance with the Terms of Reference from the Parties to the Montreal Protocol (Box 1). Additionally, we assess the linkages between solar UV radiation, the Montreal Protocol, and the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. 12\n",

            "Executive Summary Box 1. The UNEP Environmental Effects Assessment Panel (EEAP) and its Terms of Reference. • The EEAP is one of the three Assessment Panels established by the Montreal Protocol to assess various aspects of stratospheric ozone depletion ( The EEAP considers the full range of potential effects of stratospheric ozone depletion, UV radiation and the interactive effects of climate change on human health, aquatic, terrestrial ecosystems, biogeochemical cycles (e.g., movement and transformation of carbon and other elements through the biosphere and atmosphere), air quality, and materials for construction, and other uses. • The Terms of Reference of the EEAP, according to decision XXXI/2, Meeting of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol, are as follows: • The Parties to the Montreal Protocol request the Environmental Effects Assessment Panel, in drafting its 2022 report, to pay particular attention to the most recent scientific information together with future projections and scenarios, to assess the effects from changes in the ozone layer and ultraviolet radiation, and their interaction with the climate system, as well as the effects of breakdown products of controlled substances and their alternatives on: 1. The biosphere, biodiversity and ecosystem health, including on biogeochemical processes and global cycles; 2. Human health; 3. Ecosystem services, agriculture, materials for construction, transport, and photovoltaic use, as well as the generation of environmental microplastics. The findings in the 2022 Quadrennial Assessment, which are summarised here, demonstrate that the Montreal Protocol continues to play a vital role in preserving human health and maintaining healthy, diverse ecosystems on land and in the water. New findings refine and quantify the negative consequences on human health and ecosystem productivity of extreme levels of solar UV-B radiation that would have occurred without the Montreal Protocol. However, other findings show that in regions of the Earth that are not currently experiencing appreciable ozone depletion (i.e., outside polar regions), levels of solar UV-B radiation can have some beneficial effects. For example, beneficial effects may include those for human health, crop vigour and defence against pests and pathogens, food quality, and important ecosystem services, such as the disinfection of surface waters and the breakdown of environmental toxins and contaminants. Evidence that climate change is playing an increasingly important role in altering the exposure to UV radiation of organisms, ecosystems, and materials continues to mount. Changes in exposure to UV radiation are occurring through changes in extreme climate events2 , cloud cover, aerosols, snow and ice cover, mixing of ocean waters, species distributions, the seasonal patterns of growth and development (phenology), and human behaviour. 2 Ultraviolet radiation and climate change The Montreal Protocol continues to play a critical role in protecting the stratospheric ozone layer and climate, and in preventing large increases in surface UV-B radiation. While UV-B irradiances remain high under the Antarctic ozone hole, changes in UV-B radiation outside polar regions over the past several decades have been small. However, substantial interannual variability in stratospheric ozone and UV-B radiation are occurring due to changes in climate caused by increases in atmospheric greenhouse gases (GHGs). Despite large year-to-year variability, recovery of the Antarctic ozone hole by the middle of this century is still projected. Future changes in stratospheric ozone and UV-B irradiance outside polar regions are expected to be small. Recent anomalous changes in stratospheric ozone over polar regions, particularly over Antarctica, have likely contributed to extreme events, such as heat waves and wildfires, in the Southern Hemisphere. The elevated UV-B radiation together with these extreme events have the potential to significantly affect organisms and ecosystems in polar regions, especially as the climate continues to change. 2 An extreme climate event has been defined as “an episode or occurrence in which a statistically rare or unusual climatic period alters ecosystem structure and ⁄or function well outside the bounds of what is considered typical or normal variability” [8]; or similarly, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), “if the value of a variable exceeds (or lies below) a threshold” that is exceeded [9]. Compound extreme events are the “combination of multiple drivers and/or hazards that contribute to societal or environmental risk.” An example of a compound extreme event would be fire weather conditions which are the combination of hot, dry, and windy conditions [9]. 13\n",

            "Executive Summary Key findings • Nearly all studies published since our last Quadrennial Assessment have confirmed that changes in biologically effective UV radiation at the Earth’s surface outside polar regions have been small (< 4% per decade) during the last 25 years. Some locations showed small increases in the UV Index (UVI3 ), while others showed small decreases. Over the last 2–3 decades, changes in the erythemal UV radiation outside the polar regions were mainly governed by variations in clouds, aerosols, and surface reflectivity (for areas usually covered by snow or ice) rather than long-term trends in total column ozone. • The Antarctic ozone hole has resulted in large increases in surface UV-B radiation, with peak irradiances sometimes exceeding those observed in subtropical locations. Results from an updated analysis [10] confirm previous conclusions that the Antarctic ozone hole has led to large increases in the UVI at Palmer Station, Antarctica (64° S) year-round, with the largest increases occurring during spring (between 15 September and 15 November) (Fig. 1). During spring, the maximum UVI that has been observed at this site since the early 1990s is 2.5 times higher than it was in the pre-ozone-hole period (years 1970-1976) and sometimes exceeds values observed at subtropical locations (e.g., San Diego, California; 32° N). During summer and autumn (21 December – 21 June; the time of the year when there is no ozone hole); UVI maxima measured between 1990 and 2020 exceeded maxima estimated for years prior to 1976 by 20%. 16 14 12 10 8 6 4 2 0 J A S O N D J F M A M J Southern Hemisphere month 3 The UV Index is a measure of UV irradiance in terms of its effectiveness in causing sunburn (reddening of human skin; medically known as erythema). 14 xednIVUmumixaM Northern Hemisphere month J F M A M J J A S O N D Winter Spring Summer Autumn SanDiego Difference dueto ozone depletion Palmer PointBarrow MaximumUVIndexforeachdayoftheyear .

            "Executive Summary • Large inter-annual variability in the UV Index over polar regions has been observed in recent years. For example, in spring 2019, the UVI was at the minimum of the historical (1991–2018) range at the South Pole, while near record-high values, of up to 80% above the historical mean, were observed in spring 2020 (Fig. 2). A persistent Antarctic ozone hole in 2020 resulted in spikes in the UVI (red arrow in Fig. 2) in late spring when young animals are born or hatched and when plants are actively growing. The loss of protective snow cover, due to continued global warming, could further exacerbate the deleterious effects of these high spring-time UV irradiances on organisms in this region [11]. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 1-Sep 1-Oct 1-Nov 1-Dec 1-Jan Month 15 xednI VU mumixaM yliaD Arrival Heights, Antarctica (78 S, 167 E) 1989–2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 Fig. 2. Daily maximum UV Index (UVI) measured at Arrival Heights, Antarctica in 2018 (green), 2019 (yellow), 2020 (red), and 2021 (blue) compared with the average (white line) and the range (grey shading) of daily maximum observations of the years indicated in the legends. The UVI was calculated from spectra measured by a SUV-100 spectroradiometer. Up to 2009, the instrument was part of the NSF UV Monitoring Network [12] and it is now a node in the NOAA Antarctic UV Monitoring Network ( Consistent data processing methods were applied for all years [13,14]. • Recent warming and widespread heatwave events in Antarctica may have increased the exposure of plants and animals to UV-B radiation and disrupted ecosystems in this region. Since our last assessment there have been two widespread heatwave events in Antarctica. The first occurred in summer 2019/2020 when temperature records were broken around the continent [15]. The second was in March 2022 (austral autumn) when extreme temperatures, almost 40 ˚C higher than normal (-48.6° C), were reported when an atmospheric river, or plume of warm, moist air, moved onto the Antarctic plateau. Heatwaves such as these accelerate melting of snow and ice cover [16] and can expose vegetation to high springtime UV-B radiation from which they have previously been protected [17]. Warming temperatures on the Antarctic Peninsula are also opening up ice-free areas [16], causing the expansion of habitats of vascular plants [18] and increasing the possibility of new plant and animal species invading the continent [19,20]. • In the Arctic, some of the highest UV-B irradiances on record were measured in March and April 2020. The monthly average UVI over the Canadian Arctic in March 2020 was up to 70% higher than the historical (2005–2019) average, often exceeding this mean by three standard deviations. Because most Arctic organisms are protected by snow and sea ice at this time of year, they likely were not exposed to these high UV-B irradiances; however, changes in snow and ice cover resulting from climate change could expose these organisms to elevated UV-B radiation if these pronounced ozone depletion events continue to occur into the future. • Recent ozone depletion events in the Arctic have been linked to extreme weather events and melting of sea ice in this region. Heatwave conditions that occurred in the Siberian Arctic in early 2020 [21] appeared to have been aided by atmospheric circulation patterns that were affected by the strong ozone depletion of 2020 [22,23]. Ozone depletion in March 2020 may also have contributed to the prevailing reduction of sea ice in the Arctic Ocean bordering Siberia [24]. • The Montreal Protocol has prevented large increases in surface UV-B radiation, with greatest benefits at high latitudes. Modelling studies indicate that without the Montreal Protocol, the UVI at northern and southern latitudes of less than 50° would have increased by 10–20% between 1996 and 2020. For latitudes exceeding 50° S, the UVI would have increased by 25% at the southern tip of South America and by more than 100% at the South Pole in spring-time (Fig. 3).\n",

Comparison of relative changes in the UVI between 1996 and 2020 for (a) summer and (b) spring, derived from observations at nine ground stations (black symbols) and calculated from results of two chemistry-climate models (blue lines). Both climate models assume the “World Avoided” scenario where emissions of ozone depleting substances are not controlled by the Montreal Protocol. Blue shading indicates the range of these model projections. Ground stations include South Pole (90° S), Arrival Heights (78° S), Palmer Station (65° S), Lauder (45° S), Alice Springs (24° Summer S), Mauna Loa (20° N), Boulder (40° N), Thessaloniki (41° N), and Barrow (71° N). Ground stations with a nearcomplete data record for 1996–2020 are indicated by solid symbols. Sites with less than 24 years of data are shown with open symbols. Error bars indicate the 95% confidence interval of the regression model. Updated from [1]. • Surface UV radiation is expected to decrease 2–6% by 2090 at mid-latitudes with variable changes in the tropics of less than 3%. Assuming full compliance with the Montreal Protocol and constant atmospheric aerosol concentrations, modelling indicates that the UVI at mid-latitudes (30–60°) will decrease between 2015 and 2090 by 2–5% in the north and by 4–6% in the south due to recovery of the ozone layer. Changes in the UVI at the tropics over this time period are estimated to be less than 3%. • The Montreal Protocol has made direct contributions to the mitigation of global warming. Since most substances controlled by the Montreal Protocol are also potent greenhouse gases, the phase-out of these substances may have prevented warming by 0.5 to 1.0 °C over mid-latitude regions, and by more than 1.0 °C in the Arctic. According to some studies, ODSs likely contributed half of the climate-forced loss of Arctic sea ice in the latter half of the 20th century, although there are large uncertainties associated with these estimates. • The Montreal Protocol is indirectly mitigating climate change by protecting the global vegetation carbon sink. If the production of ODSs had not been controlled by the Montreal Protocol, effective UV-B radiation, when weighted according to damaging effects on plants, could have increased by about a factor of five over the 21st century4 [25]. Plants exposed to this extreme UV-B radiation would have experienced reduced photosynthesis and growth, which would have resulted in an estimated 325–690 billion tonnes less carbon held in terrestrial vegetation by the end of this century. This reduction in carbon sequestration would have resulted in an additional 115–235 parts per million of carbon dioxide (CO ) in the atmosphere, causing an additional rise of global2 mean surface temperature of 0.5–1.0 °C (Fig. 4). 4 “World Avoided” scenarios, such as the scenario discussed here, are inevitably only estimates based on the state of current knowledge. They cannot consider possible changes in human behaviour and policies that may come about when large changes in UV irradiance and their consequences become more obvious in the future. Nevertheless, these projections allow us to put the crucial benefits that the Montreal Protocol has brought to date into perspective.\n",

[25]. 3 Human health Exposure to excessive UV radiation can result in a number of deleterious effects on human health, including skin cancer (Fig. 5) and cataract. However, it is estimated that millions of cases of these diseases have been avoided due to the Montreal Protocol. Moderate exposure to UV radiation can have some beneficial effects on human health, most notably the production of vitamin D. It is likely that by avoiding large increases in UV-B radiation, the Montreal Protocol has allowed humans to safely tolerate time outdoors, thereby gaining the benefits of sun exposure. This may have reduced the risk or severity of several diseases, particularly those related to immune function, such as multiple sclerosis. Solar UV radiation may also have played a role in inactivating the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic (SARS-CoV-2) and in influencing people’s immune system responses to viral infection. However, available evidence suggests it to be unlikely that the Montreal Protocol has had a major effect on the COVID-19 pandemic. Key findings • Modelling studies indicate that the Montreal Protocol is contributing to the prevention of skin cancer. Results from an updated study [26] indicate that the Montreal Protocol will have prevented millions of cases of skin cancers (melanoma and keratinocyte cancers) in the United States for people born between 1890 – 2100 (Table 1). The model estimated that people born in 2040 or later will not experience excess risk of skin cancer caused by the effect of ozone depletion on UV-B radiation, assuming continued compliance with the Montreal Protocol. While this study highlights the critical importance of the Montreal Protocol, an important limitation is that these estimates assume no changes in sun exposure behaviour, skin screening or population structure, such as in the distribution of skin types. Other limitations include uncertainty regarding stratospheric ozone trends and the choice of the action spectrum for DNA damage. 17\n",
            "\n",
            "Executive Summary Fig. 5. Skin cancer resulting from exposure to UV radiation occurs primarily as a consequence of direct and indirect (via reactive oxygen species) DNA damage and immune suppression. • The incidence of malignant melanoma continues to increase in many developed countries, but trends vary with population and age. Incidence has increased in some countries (e.g., United Kingdom, Sweden, Canada, Norway, France, and Lithuania), but declined or stabilised in others (e.g., Hungary, Australia, and Denmark) [27-32]. In Canada, Italy and England the incidence of melanoma increased in older age groups but declined or stabilised in younger age groups [33-35]. The increases in the rates of skin cancer in older age groups are most likely the result of high lifetime sun exposure, rather than to changes in stratospheric ozone. The stabilising or decreasing incidence in younger age groups in some jurisdictions may reflect migration patterns, increased use of sun protection strategies, and a social shift in occupational and recreational activities from outdoors to indoors. In the absence of the Montreal Protocol, these declines may not have been observed. • Keratinocyte skin cancers are the most common cancer in the world and pose a significant burden on human health and economies. Keratinocyte skin cancers (KC) include basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). An analysis of Global Burden of Disease (GBD) data found that in 2019 KC was the most common cancer globally, affecting almost 3 times as many people as the next most common cancer (lung, 2.2 million people) [36,37]. Death due to BCC is very rare, but ~56,000 people died due to SCC. The burden of disease, as measured by disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), increased by almost 25% between 2010 and 2019. The incidence of KC has increased in many locations, including Australia, New Zealand, Iceland, and the United Kingdom, but in the United States the incidence remained fairly stable from 2005 to 2019. The lifetime risk of KC is much higher in populations living in conditions with high ambient UV radiation; for example, the lifetime risk is 3.5 times higher in Australia than in the United Kingdom [38,39]. The cost of KC in terms of medical treatment and lost worker productivity is very high and increasing. For example, the average paid and unpaid productivity loss per premature death from melanoma in Europe are the second highest of all cancers, and in the United States between 1997 and 2015, total expenditure for treatment of melanoma increased at a faster rate than for other cancers. In Australia, skin cancer (KC and melanoma combined) costs more to treat than any other cancer. These high costs point to the potential economic benefits of the Montreal Protocol with respect to skin cancer prevention. • Solar UV radiation causes or worsens inflammatory skin disorders (photodermatoses) and can contribute to phototoxicity of certain medications. Photodermatoses are inflammatory skin disorders that are induced or exacerbated by exposure to UV radiation (UV-B and UV-A radiation) and sometimes visible radiation. These disorders can lead to substantial decreases in the quality of life, due both to the morbidity associated with the conditions and to the reduction in work and recreational activities that are needed to manage these conditions. A considerable number of common oral medications (e.g., diuretics and anti-inflammatory drugs) [40] exhibit photosensitising potential, whereby individuals exposed to sufficient doses of these drugs together with UV radiation can experience skin reddening, swelling and burning. Photosensitising drugs may increase the risk of skin cancer through UV-induced DNA damage, but further studies are required to adequately assess this risk. • Modelling studies indicate that the Montreal Protocol will reduce the incidence of cataract. Long-term exposure of eyes to UV radiation can cause cataract, which is the leading cause of blindness world-wide [41-45]. Access to care is the main determinant of vision loss due to cataract, and individuals living in regions with high ambient UV radiation and limited access to care (such as in parts of Asia, Oceania and Sub-Saharan Africa) experience above average incidences of moderate to severe vision impairment [41,43,45]. In the United States, model estimates indicate that the Montreal Protocol will prevent 63 million cases of cataract for individuals born between 1890 – 2100 (Table 1). 18\n",

Totals may not sum due to independent rounding. • Exposing the skin and eyes to solar radiation leads to the production of vitamin D, modulates the immune system, and can have other beneficial effects on health. The best known benefit of exposing the skin to the sun, and in particular UV-B radiation, is production of vitamin D. Vitamin D is essential for maintaining musculoskeletal health but recent findings also indicate that low levels of 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25(OH)D), the molecule measured to assess vitamin D status, may also be associated with increased risk of a range of health outcomes, including multiple sclerosis [46], respiratory tract infections [47], and coronary heart disease [48]. Separately from vitamin D, exposing the skin to UV radiation modulates the immune system, both locally within the skin and at distant body sites. This has dual effects, increasing the risk of skin cancer, but downregulating inflammation. There is emerging evidence that UV-A radiation (and possibly UV-B), can release nitric oxide from the skin with benefits for blood pressure and metabolism. Exposing the eyes to the sun reduces the risk of short-sightedness. Balancing the risks and benefits of sun exposure is challenging. In the absence of the Montreal Protocol the high UV indices that would have occurred would have caused skin damage in a very short time, limiting the time people could spend outdoors and reducing the benefits of sun exposure. • Solar UV radiation can inactivate SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, but the Montreal Protocol has likely had a minimal effect on COVID-19 transmission. A newly-developed action spectrum indicates that both UV-B and UV-A radiation can inactivate the SARS-CoV-2 virus [49]. Estimates of the exposure time required for virus inactivation vary among studies, but the most reliable data suggest that 90% of viral particles embedded in saliva are inactivated within ca. 7 minutes by solar radiation under optimal high-sun conditions, as would occur under clear skies near midday during summer at midto low latitudes. Longer exposures to solar UV radiation (exceeding ~13 minutes) would be required for inactivation early or late in the day during winter at higher latitudes [50-52]. Slightly longer inactivation times were found for aerosolised virus particles, and inactivation times would be longer for cloudy conditions or if virus particles are shielded from solar radiation. As the primary mode of transmission of this virus from person to person appears to occur through respiratory droplets and aerosols generated by breathing, sneezing, and coughing in crowded indoor conditions [53-57], disinfection by UV radiation of outdoor surfaces is unlikely to have played a significant part in controlling COVID-19. • Exposure to ambient levels of solar UV radiation may contribute to a reduced incidence or severity of COVID-19, but causal mechanisms are unclear and uncertainty is high. A number of studies have shown that the incidence or severity of COVID-19 is inversely related to ambient solar UV radiation (i.e., fewer cases and less severe COVID-19 with greater intensity of UV radiation), but there are many possible confounding factors (e.g., other environmental factors such as temperature, humidity and total solar radiation, as well as factors affecting viral transmission and disease management). The causal nature of these relationships is therefore unclear. Some studies have found inverse associations between vitamin D (25(OH)D) concentration in the blood and the risk of SARSCoV-2 positivity or severity of COVID-19. If vitamin D is found to be causally associated with COVID-19 risk or outcomes, or if other effects of UV radiation on the immune system are important, extreme care would be required to balance these beneficial effects of sun exposure against the risks of sunburn and skin cancer in people with light skin. In general, the far-reaching, positive outcomes of the implementation of the Montreal Protocol for human health outweigh any potential advantage that might have been gained by the effects of solar UV radiation on the transmission and severity of COVID-19 that would have occurred in the absence of the Montreal Protocol. Perhaps most importantly, the Montreal Protocol has avoided large increases in UV-B radiation that would likely have caused people to spend less time outdoors, and more time indoors where the risk of COVID-19 infection is much higher. 19\n",

            "Executive Summary 4 Terrestrial ecosystems and biogeochemical cycles Changes in UV radiation and climate interact to affect terrestrial ecosystems and biogeochemical cycles (i.e., the cycling of nutrients such as carbon and nitrogen), with potential consequences for food security, biodiversity, and climate. Exposure to extreme solar UV radiation, as would have occurred without the Montreal Protocol, would have had pronounced deleterious effects on many plants, animals, and microorganisms. However, most species in terrestrial environments have evolved mechanisms to tolerate or avoid the harmful effects of solar UV radiation, at least at levels within the range experienced without significant ozone depletion. Nonetheless, these moderate levels of solar UV radiation together with climate change can affect the productivity and biodiversity of terrestrial ecosystems, including agroecosystems, by altering food quality, plant defence against pests and pathogens, plant vigour and tolerances to other abiotic stresses, and the photodegradation of plant litter and pesticides. Importantly, the photodegradation of plant litter by UV and short-wavelength visible radiation can enhance decomposition and nutrient cycling, resulting in emission of GHGs, such as carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide, with positive feedbacks on the climate system. Key findings • Extreme climate events are becoming more prevalent with climate change, and these events are likely to alter the exposure of organisms to UV radiation and disrupt terrestrial ecosystems. Globally, stronger storms, catastrophic floods, protracted droughts, anomalous heat waves, more intense wildfires, and other extreme climate events (ECEs5) are causing long-term disruption to the structure and function of many terrestrial ecosystems [58,59]. Together with changes in cloud cover and aerosols, these ECEs are likely altering the UV radiation received by terrestrial organisms outside polar regions to a greater degree than current or projected changes in stratospheric ozone concentrations (Fig. 6). While these alterations in solar UV irradiation have the potential to affect biodiversity, productivity, emissions of GHGs [60-62], and ecosystem carbon storage [63], the magnitude of these impacts are unknown at the present time. • Ongoing changes in climate are exposing plants to new combinations of UV radiation and other environmental factors that can affect stress tolerances and food quality. A combination of particular concern is high UV-B irradiance and drought, as climate change is increasing the frequency and severity of drought. Drought periods frequently coincide with high UV radiation, particularly at mid to low latitudes [9]. Because of shared molecular pathways in stress tolerance mechanisms, the response of plants to moderate levels of UV radiation may confer some cross-protection against drought [64,65]. This cross-tolerance might mitigate some of the detrimental effects of drought on crop growth and yield, unless both stress factors are excessive. UV radiation and climate factors can also interact to have both positive and negative effects on nutritional quality of food, depending on type of crop and environmental conditions [66]. Fig 6. Pathways by which extreme climate events (ECEs) driven by changes in stratospheric ozone and climate can affect UV radiation exposure and terrestrial organisms and ecosystems. Changes in stratospheric ozone and climate interact to influence the frequency and intensity of a number of ECEs (upper-most grey rectangles). These ECEs in turn affect atmospheric and surface intermediaries (multi-coloured ovals connected with ECEs by overlapping shaded regions) which can increase (+) or decrease (-) the solar UV radiation reaching terrestrial organisms and ecosystems. Solid arrows show direct mediation by climate, ozone and UV radiation on ECEs and potential interactive and feedback effects. Dashed arrows show chronic effects of climate change factors. 5 An extreme climate event has been defined as “an episode or occurrence in which a statistically rare or unusual climatic period alters ecosystem structure and ⁄or function well outside the bounds of what is considered typical or normal variability” [8]; or similarly, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), “if the value of a variable exceeds (or lies below) a threshold” that is exceeded [9]. Compound extreme events are the “combination of multiple drivers and/or hazards that contribute to societal or environmental risk.” An example of a compound extreme event would be fire weather conditions which are the combination of hot, dry, and windy conditions [9]. 20\n",

            "Executive Summary • Certain crops, especially those grown in the tropics and montane environments, may be vulnerable to relatively small increases in UV-B radiation. Because of shifting bioclimatic zones with climate change, certain crops are being grown at higher elevations than was previously possible [e.g., 67,68]. For some species of crop plants, especially those grown in the tropics, the intense UV radiation at higher elevations may exceed their UV tolerances, resulting in damage to DNA and proteins with negative consequences for their physiology and growth [69]. As crop species are grown in new habitats, they also encounter new weeds, pests, and pathogens [70,71]. Exposure to UV radiation is known to influence competition between plants and defence against herbivores [72,73] such that the altered UV radiation conditions may further disrupt the structure and function of these agroecosystems by affecting interactions of crop plants with weeds and pests. Differential effects of climate change on range shifts and phenology can also lead to spatial and/or temporal or seasonal mismatches between pollinators and their plant hosts [74,75], posing a risk to both agroecosystem function and food security. • Climate change can contribute to declines in biodiversity by reducing the availability of suitable habitats for species and by shifting their distribution ranges, which alters exposure to UV radiation and may disrupt species interactions. Plant and animal species are migrating and shifting their distribution ranges to higher elevations and latitudes in response to on-going changes in climate [76-78], and these changes can decrease (poleward shifts) or increase (elevational shifts) exposures to solar UV radiation. Some models suggest that UV radiation can interact with climate change to influence species distributions, although the mechanisms underlying these effects are unclear. Nonetheless, changes in UV irradiances resulting from these shifts will likely modify plant growth forms and secondary chemistry (e.g., flavonoids and other phenolic compounds), which may affect the competitive ability of plants and their defence against herbivores [79,72]. Depending on location, these changes in species interactions have the potential to negatively affect biodiversity [80]. • Solar UV radiation can accelerate the decomposition of dead plant matter (litter) in many terrestrial ecosystems with implications for carbon storage and climate. The decomposition of plant litter is a key biogeochemical process determining rates of nutrient cycling, energy flow, and carbon storage in terrestrial ecosystems. Exposure of litter to solar UV radiation and shortwavelength visible radiation (i.e., blue and green light), can increase rates of litter decomposition via the direct photochemical breakdown of lignin and other plant cell wall constituents (i.e., photomineralisation), and indirectly, by enhancing microbial decomposition (i.e., photofacilitation). Photodegradation of litter is now recognised to be important in a wide variety of ecosystems across a range of climatic regions (e.g., deserts, grasslands, forests), although the relative importance of photomineralisation vs photofacilitation may differ among habitats [81]. A newly developed action spectrum for photomineralisation indicates that UV-A is more effective than UV-B radiation in driving this process. Thus, ozone depletion likely has minimal effect on this aspect of photodegradation [82]. Photodegradation influences the cycling and storage of carbon as well as other elements (e.g., nitrogen and phosphorous) and can be an important pathway of GHG emissions by terrestrial ecosystems [83,84]. • Thawing of permafrost is destabilising Arctic ecosystems and exposing ancient sources of organic carbon to photodegradation by solar UV radiation. The world’s soils store large amounts of carbon, approximately two-to-three times more than the atmosphere (Fig. 7A). Therefore, even small instabilities or degradation of soils driven by perturbations in climate can lead to large releases of carbon. A large proportion of soil carbon is stored at high northern latitudes, where it has remained stable in peatlands and permafrost soils over long time periods, often many thousands of years. As climate warms, permafrost is thawing [85], leading to the decomposition of this ancient organic matter and the release of carbon dioxide, methane and other GHGs. The organic matter from thawed permafrost soils enters aquatic ecosystems as dissolved organic matter (DOM) where it becomes susceptible to photodegradation by solar UV radiation [86]. Reductions in ice and snow or changes in vegetation and cloud cover are further modifying exposures to UV irradiation, which affect the magnitude of these photodegradation processes and Arctic organisms (Fig. 7B). • Photodegradation of dissolved organic matter by UV radiation in aquatic ecosystems releases greenhouse gases that may exacerbate climate change. Climate change is enhancing terrestrial runoff rich in dissolved organic matter (DOM) to lakes, rivers, and coastal waters, which increases the amount of DOM that is subjected to photodegradation. Another important source of DOM is the permafrost soils of the Northern Hemisphere (Fig. 7). Emissions of CO resulting from photodegradation of DOM at mid-latitudes 2 are generally negligible compared to emissions from microbial mineralisation of DOM but may play a large role at high latitudes. The magnitude of the direct abiotic photochemical degradation (i.e., photomineralisation) of DOM in Arctic watersheds rich in yedoma (organic-rich permafrost, [87]) is still uncertain, with estimates ranging from negligible [88-90] to 75–90% of total CO emissions [912 93]. Understanding how DOM photoreactivity varies across seasons and with water chemistry is crucial to predicting the extent of photochemical CO emissions in high latitude ecosystems and their variations induced by changes in climate and UV radiation. 2 21\n",

Panel A shows the carbon stocks in various types of soils (brown bars) and the atmosphere (blue bar). The lighter extended bar gives the contribution from permafrost soils greater than 3 m depths that is not relevant to the other soil types. Reproduced and modified from [94]. Panel B illustrates the effects of warming on permafrost. Prior to climate change, soils and vegetation were covered for much of the year (left). Warming leads to reduced snow cover, permafrost thaw, and subsequent increased frequency of disturbance events such as fire, floods, droughts and insect damage causing dieback. Inset circles illustrate how solar UV radiation interacts with these climate driven processes in soil (a-c) and waterbodies (d). Climate change is causing the active top layer of soil to thaw during the summer and freeze again in the autumn. This active layer is becoming deeper and staying unfrozen for longer. 5 Aquatic ecosystems Changes in stratospheric ozone along with climate change and human activity are altering the aquatic environment and modifying the exposure of aquatic ecosystems to UV radiation with potential consequences for species distributions, biogeochemical cycles, and services provided by these ecosystems. Climate change results in variations in the depth of mixing, thickness of ice cover, the duration of ice-free conditions, and inputs of dissolved organic matter, all of which can either increase or decrease exposure to UV radiation (Fig. 8). Human activities release contaminants such as oil, UV filters in sunscreens, and microplastics into the aquatic environment, which are then modified by UV radiation, frequently amplifying adverse effects on aquatic organisms and aquatic environments. These changes combine with other environmental changes such as global warming and ocean acidification to impact microorganisms, macroalgae, and plants and animals in aquatic environments. Minimising the disruptive consequences of these effects on critical services provided by the world’s rivers, lakes, and oceans (e.g., freshwater supply, recreation, transport, and food security) will not only require continued adherence to the Montreal Protocol but also a wider inclusion of solar UV radiation and its effects in studies and/or models of aquatic ecosystems under conditions of the future global climate. Key findings • Ozone depletion and climate change are altering exposure to UV radiation in the ocean’s surface layers by changing the depth of the mixed layer, but effects vary with latitude. An analysis of almost 50 years (1970-2018) of data from sensors on free-floating devices and ships show a deepening of the water circulation over the global ocean. The maximum depth of circulation from the surface, the mixed layer depth (MLD; Fig. 8), has deepened, on average, by 2.9 % per decade, adding around 5-10 m per decade to the MLD [95]. The deeper organisms circulate, the less they are exposed to UV radiation. Deepening trends do vary regionally, with greater deepening in much of the Southern Ocean and less deepening in the North Atlantic, whereas shallowing is occurring for some areas near the Equator and in high Arctic latitudes. Deeper mixing in the Southern Ocean is linked to the strengthening of surface winds associated with the positive phase of the Southern Annular Mode, which is influenced by ozone depletion [96]. 22\n",

            "Executive Summary Fig. 8. Schematic depiction of processes controlling exposure to UV-B radiation in aquatic ecosystems comparing before and after the Anthropocene (i.e., the current period of significant human impact on the Earth’s ecosystems). In general, exposure to UV-B radiation is limited to the surface layer (light blue/brown), the mixing of which depends on the stratifying effect of surface warming and inputs of fresh water vs the stirring effects of surface winds and currents. Ice cover shields the polar ocean and wintertime lakes (not shown). In oceans in the Anthropocene, generally there is more warming, more wind, and a greater mixed layer depth (MLD), while sharpening the density barrier (pycnocline, dark blue) to nutrient transport (arrows) from deep water (black). However, ice melt reduces shielding and freshens the polar ocean reducing the MLD. Terrestrial run-off from rain events browns lake surface water, lowers transparency to UV-B radiation and warms surface waters due to enhanced absorption of solar radiation. Drought would have the opposite effect. The warming results in shallower mixed layers in lakes, as do weaker winds. Dimensions are not to scale. • Anthropogenic factors in combination with UV radiation are exacerbating stresses on aquatic ecosystems, especially tropical coral reef ecosystems. Tropical coral reefs, which are based on the symbiotic association between reef-building corals and symbiotic dinoflagellates (Family Symbiodiniaceae), are highly diverse and economically important ecosystems that are naturally exposed to high levels of UV radiation because they occur in clear, tropical waters close to the surface. Findings from some studies indicate that exposure to UV-B radiation can have detrimental effects on symbionts, although negative effects are often not evident on the coral host [97]. Stress on symbionts can lead to their expulsion from the coral host and coral bleaching. These negative effects on symbiont health are a concern as coral bleaching is becoming more common as sea surface waters continue to warm and become more acidic. These effects may exacerbate the impact of UV-B radiation on coral ecosystems. Coral reefs may also be vulnerable to oil pollutants and chemicals from sunscreens, the toxic effects of which can be enhanced by UV-B radiation and climate change [98,99] (Fig. 9). 23\n",

            "Executive Summary Fig 9. Coral reef-dwelling organisms, such as reef-building corals, are affected by stressors such as warming of sea surface waters and by contaminants such as oil and UV filters (e.g., sunscreens). In near-surface waters, corals are also exposed to high levels of UV radiation, the potentially damaging effects of which are moderated by photoprotection mechanisms. Nevertheless, the negative impacts of stressors and contaminants are exacerbated by co-exposure to UV-A and UV-B radiation. Photo: Sandra Mendoza Quiroz. • Solar UV radiation degrades oil pollutants but enhances their toxicity to aquatic organisms. Recent studies have confirmed that solar UV radiation is a key factor contributing to the removal of pollutants from oil spills (reviewed by [100]). For example, during the 102 days of the Deepwater Horizon spill, UV-driven production of water soluble organic carbon (also referred to as photo-dissolution) accounted for about 8% (estimated range: 3-17%) of overall oil removal, an amount comparable to other widely acknowledged removal processes (evaporation and coastal stranding) [101]. Exposure to high amounts of UV radiation can also increase the toxicity of some oil components for corals, sponges, molluscs, polychaetes, and crustaceans [99]. Typically, exposure to UV radiation has not been a part of oil toxicity studies, but these results suggest that including such exposures in future studies would improve our understanding of the fate and toxicity of oil spills occurring at or near the ocean’s surface [102]. 6 Air quality and contaminants Solar UV radiation is a major contributor to the formation of air pollution (tropospheric ozone (O ) and some particulate matter 3 (PM)), which has been identified as a critical issue in human health world-wide. However, UV radiation also plays a role in cleansing the atmosphere of pollutants, and air pollution can affect the penetration of UV radiation to the Earth’s surface. Thus, changes in stratospheric ozone and climate can have complex and sometimes opposing effects on different types of air pollution. Solar UV radiation also plays an important role in the breakdown of contaminants in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, but the ecological and human health consequences of these transformations are not yet well understood. Contamination of the environment by compounds used to replace ODS remains a concern. Key findings • Solar UV radiation, particularly UV-B radiation, can worsen tropospheric air quality with appreciable harmful effects on human health. Globally, poor outdoor air quality causes extensive morbidity and over 4 million premature deaths per year related to respiratory, cardiovascular, reproductive and neurological disorders. Improvements in some aspects of air quality (e.g., PM) have occurred in some regions (e.g., China), because stringent measures to control pollution have led to long-term reductions in emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulfur dioxide (SO )—necessary ingredients for the UV-driven formation of tropospheric O 2 3 and PM. Decreases in UV-B radiation, as a result of the Montreal Protocol, would be expected to result in a reduced net production of O near sources of pollution (e.g., cities with large emissions of NOx from traffic) and a slower consumption of O with increasing 3 3 distance from polluted areas. Future scenarios in which stratospheric O returns to 1980 values or even exceeds them, could help 3 ameliorate urban O pollution but may worsen O pollution reaching rural areas. For PM, sensitivity to changes in UV radiation is 3 3 expected based on knowledge of the relevant photochemical processes, but has not been studied systematically and hence remains unquantified. 24\n",
            "\n",
            "Executive Summary • Tropospheric ozone and particulate matter can have adverse effects on forests and the yields of crops in rural areas, with important economic consequences. Tropospheric O is known to contribute to significant losses in growth, quality and yield of 3 crops and other plants, and recent studies have further quantified these effects. For example, a recent meta-analysis of 48 studies examining the effects of chronic tropospheric O exposure on soybeans conducted between 1980 and 2019 showed that O 3 3 reduced leaf-area by 21%, leaf, shoot and root biomass by 14%, 23% and 17%, respectively, and seed yield by 28% [103]. A study on the historical losses to air pollutants in maize and soybean grown in the United States showed that improvements in the control of O , SO , PM, and NO have increased yields by an average of 20% [104]. Of these pollutants, PM and NO appeared to cause 3 2 2 2 more damage than O and SO . Overall, the improvement in yields from stricter controls of the pollutants was equivalent to ca US$ 5 3 2 billion. • Solar UV radiation also plays a major role in cleansing the troposphere of pollutants and greenhouse gases. UV-generated hydroxyl radicals (OH), the major cleaning agents of the troposphere, remove many atmospheric pollutants and GHGs (Fig. 10). Research has shown that increases in UV radiation caused by stratospheric ozone depletion over 1980-2020 have contributed a small increase (ca. 3%) to the concentration of globally averaged OH, alongside several other variables that affect OH (e.g., temperature, humidity, and increased emissions of precursors of tropospheric O ). Hydroxyl radicals react with many environmentally important 3 chemicals including some GHGs (e.g., methane; CH ) and some ODSs, such as the so-called very-short-lived substances (VSLSs; 4 halo-organics with an atmospheric lifetime of less than or equal to 6 months). These reactions control both the lifetimes and the amounts of such chemicals in the atmosphere. For CH , the UV-related increase in OH is the equivalent of offsetting increases in the 4 concentration by 40 ppb or decreasing emissions by ~15 Tg y-1. For the VSLSs, the changes in OH are part of a complex feedback (Fig. 10) that is not yet fully quantified. Fig. 10. Interacting effects of UV-B radiation and tropospheric O 3 and water (H O) on tropospheric 2 concentrations of OH and on the lifetime of very-short-lived substances (VSLSs). Effects of climate change include more frequent wildfires and thawing of permafrost soils with the formation of thermokarst lakes, which are important sources of CO and CH , 4 respectively. Increased emissions of CO and CH tend to decrease the 4 tropospheric OH concentration, which in turn results in longer lifetime of VSLSs and thus a higher probability of stratospheric ozone depletion. • The increases in trifluoroacetic acid concentrations due to replacements of the ozone-depleting substances are not expected to pose significant risk to humans or the environment at the present time. Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) continues to be found in the environment, including in remote regions, although concentrations are so low that they are currently very unlikely to have adverse toxicological consequences for humans and ecosystems [105,106]. The accumulated amount of TFA is expected to increase because of the planned replacement of ODS with short-lived fluorinated chemicals (Fig. 11). However, based on projected future use of these precursors of TFA, no harm is anticipated. There is a large uncertainty associated with the magnitude of other sources of TFA (e.g., potential natural sources, fluorinated pesticides, and pharmaceuticals), which do not fall under the purview of the Montreal Protocol. Trifluoroacetic acid has biological properties that differ significantly from the longer chain polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and inclusion of TFA in this larger group of chemicals for regulation would be inconsistent with the risk assessment of TFA. 25\n",

Yields of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) from selected individual chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) replacement compounds, as well as the estimated global emissions of these compounds. The figure also includes selected compounds not under the purview of the Montreal Protocol. Error bars represent both experimental uncertainties and upper and lower yield ranges due to competing reaction channels that depend on environmental conditions. The yields of TFA from individual compounds are estimated based on evaluations of the available literature. Note split scale for the emission of HFC-134a is much higher than that of other compounds. 7 Materials and plastics Solar UV radiation contributes to the aging and degradation of textiles as well as natural and synthetic materials, such as wood and plastics used in building materials. This degradation occurs on the surface of materials that then allows for other environmental agents, such as heat and moisture, to enter and deteriorate deeper layers. Superficial changes caused by UV radiation therefore lead to an overall ageing of a material. Thus, ozone depletion and climate change interact to affect the ageing process of materials and their service lifetimes. New technologies have been developed that can minimise these ageing effects, thereby resulting in longer lifetimes, diminished use of natural resources and waste, and reduced release of potentially harmful microand nano-plastics. However, the production of plastics and accumulation of microand nano-plastics in the environment, especially aquatic environments, continues to be of concern. Secondary microplastics can be generated in the environment during fragmentation of plastic litter that is photo-oxidised by solar UV radiation. By preventing increases in UV radiation, the Montreal Protocol has likely resulted in a slower generation and accumulation of microplastics in the environment than would have occurred without this treaty. 26\n",
            "\n",
            "Executive Summary Key findings • More environmentally-friendly additives are being developed and used in plastics and wood to reduce the degradation of these materials by solar UV radiation. The recent trend towards development of environmentally sustainable technologies and building materials has necessitated the use of plant-based, non-toxic additives in coatings, plastics, and sunscreens [107-109]. In selecting additives, including UV-stabilisers [110], for plastics or coatings, increasing attention is being paid to minimising their potential ecotoxicity as these additives often leach out to contaminate the environment [111]. Some wood extractives and lignin nanoparticles have been tested for their efficacy as UV shielding material against surface discolouration of wood. Nanoparticles of lignin applied to coatings and even sunscreens have shown promise for substituting or complementing synthetic UV-absorbers. However, the undesirable dark colour of lignin is a drawback in lignin-based UV-shielding products and needs to be addressed. • New technologies are being developed to increase the lifespan of photovoltaic modules used in solar panels. Polymers in photovoltaic (PV) modules undergo oxidation when exposed to solar UV irradiation and this causes brittleness, degradation and reduced lifetime of these systems [112-115] (Fig. 12). While accelerated laboratory testing has improved understanding of the different degradation mechanisms in PV modules, accurate prediction of degradation of these systems in the outdoors and under actual in-use conditions is still lacking [116]. Efforts to find a better replacement for the encapsulant material used in these systems has yielded several candidate polymers, such as ionomers and thermoplastic polyolefin [117]; and novel transparent backsheets designed to work specifically with bifacial PV cells and modules are being introduced. These modules will collect reflected sunlight on the back side of the module to increase power generation per unit area [118]. Fig. 12. Components of a crystalline silicon photovoltaic (PV) module illustrating encapsulants, backsheet, and junction box that are made of plastic materials, which are susceptible to degradation by solar UV radiation [119]. • Solar UV radiation causes weathering of plastics, which ultimately results in fragmentation and the formation of microand nano-plastics. Plastic debris in the environment is perceived as an increasing pollution problem with an estimated 8300 million metric tons being produced since the 1950s, of which ca 80% have ended in landfills and the natural environment [120]. In the natural environment, micro(<5 mm) and nano-plastics (<0.1 µm) are generated as a result of solar UV-driven weathering of plastic debris in combination with fragmentation due to exposure to mechanical forces [121] (Fig. 13). Exposure to solar UV radiation is a primary weathering mechanism of plastics debris. Such photo-oxidation of plastic debris under extended outdoor exposure makes the material weak, brittle and prone to subsequent fragmentation [122,123]. Fragmentation then occurs when plastics are subjected to factors such as wave action or encounters with animals, resulting in the generation of secondary microor nano-particles. While there are concerns about potential effects of microand nanoplastics, the risks of these pollutants to human health and the environment are at present unclear. Nonetheless, there are calls for a global treaty on plastics towards a more sustainable future [124]. • The implementation of the Montreal Protocol, and consequent avoidance of high solar UV-B radiation, has likely prevented increases in the generation of microplastics in the environment. Large increases in terrestrial solar UV-B radiation, which have been avoided by the Montreal Protocol, would have increased the rates of UV-driven photo-oxidation, and consequently fragmentation of plastic debris that produces microplastics. However, estimates of the impact of the Montreal Protocol on microplastic production are limited by uncertainties in the UV dose-response of photo-oxidative reactions, and the distribution of plastics within different environments (soil, water, etc.), which affect exposure to UV radiation. Thus, while UV driven photo-oxidation of plastics, and subsequent fragmentation are well documented, the quantitative impact of this process on plastic longevity, microplastic generation, and ecological impacts remains unknown at present 27\n",
            "\n",
            "Executive Summary Fig. 13. Solar UV radiation can drive the photo-oxidation of plastics, making plastics susceptible to fragmentation, a process that may result in the formation of microand nano-plastic particles. Plastic mineralisation has been reported, but the relevance of this process in the natural environment remains to be established. The climate has impacts on photo-oxidation through a variety of different routes, including direct effects on solar UV radiation, plastic dispersal, penetration of UV radiation through the water column, and rising temperatures. 8 Conclusions The Executive Summary, together with the full Quadrennial Assessment, illustrate the diversity of ways that changes in stratospheric ozone, UV radiation and climate interact to affect human health and the environment. While exposure to solar UV radiation, and, in particular, UV-B radiation, can have deleterious effects on humans and other organisms, modest exposure to UV radiation can have beneficial effects on human health, food quality and plant defence against pests, the disinfection of waters, and the conversion of toxic contaminants to more benign by-products [125,60,126]. Maintaining an optimal balance between the positive and negative effects of solar UV radiation would have been difficult to achieve, if not impossible, without the Montreal Protocol. Evidence also continues to mount showing that the Montreal Protocol is directly and indirectly protecting the Earth’s climate and mitigating some of the negative consequences of climate change [5,25]. Since our last Quadrennial Assessment, the world has experienced continued increases in global temperatures, additional extreme climate events (ECEs, e.g., heat waves, droughts, and hurricanes) and events resulting from a combination of weather extremes and other drivers (e.g., wildfires) that have all contributed to increasing societal and environmental risk. As recently reported by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [9], ECEs are expected to increase in frequency and intensity in the future because of anthropogenic climate change. The ECEs, together with other aspects of climate change (e.g., changing cloud cover and aerosols), alter the exposure to UV radiation of humans, plants, animals, and materials to a greater degree than the expected changes in the stratospheric ozone layer—assuming continued and full compliance with the Montreal Protocol. While our knowledge of the interactive effects of ozone depletion, UV radiation, and climate change has advanced since our last Quadrennial Assessment, a number of uncertainties persist that limit our ability to precisely and quantitatively assess the full extent and magnitude of these effects. Notably, it is uncertain how surface UV radiation will change in the future as the climate continues to change and to what degree the environmental and human effects of climate change are modulated by concurrent changes in stratospheric ozone and UV radiation. These factors are especially important considering future scenarios that might involve solar radiation management and climate intervention [127-130]. Despite these uncertainties, it is clear from this Quadrennial Assessment that the Montreal Protocol has been vital in protecting humans, aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, air quality, and natural and synthetic materials from the deleterious consequences of stratospheric ozone depletion [131,1]. By protecting the stratospheric ozone layer and mitigating some of the effects of climate change, the Montreal Protocol continues to contribute to the implementation of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Specifically, the EEAP shows the alignment of the Montreal Protocol and its Amendments by addressing 21 targets in 11 of the 17 SDGs (Box 2). These SDGs address 28\n",

            "highlights highlights environmental effects assessment panel 2022 quadrennial assessment environmental effects of stratospheric ozone depletion, uv radiation, and interactions with climate change the highlights of the 2022 quadrennial assessment focus on major findings since the last assessment, acknowledging the contribution of the montreal protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer to several of the united nations sustainable development goals and the alignment of the panel with these goals. the strong interconnected effects of stratospheric ozone depletion, ultraviolet (uv) radiation, and climate change are increasingly evident and complex, with consequences for life on earth and a sustainable future. within this context, the highlights cover current and projected consequences for human health (including the covid-19 pandemic), terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, air quality, natural and synthetic materials, and microplastics. 1 ultraviolet radiation, stratospheric ozone depletion, and climate change • concentrations of stratospheric ozone in the future will depend on the decrease in ozone-depleting substances (odss) controlled by the montreal protocol, other substances currently not controlled, and on emissions of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide. the trajectory of these emissions depends greatly on policy decisions. • large increases in uv radiation were observed during the 2020 antarctic and arctic springs, when the uv index rose by to 80% and 70%, respectively, above the historical means. • in the antarctic, these anomalously high amounts of uv radiation extended over spring and the start of summer, and may have had negative consequences for migrating animals returning to breed, which may not have been adapted to the unusually high uv irradiation. • increasing warming will lead to more ice melt and increased exposure of ecosystems to uv radiation on land and in water bodies, especially in polar and high-elevation regions. • thawing of permafrosts will result in the release of uv-absorbing organic carbon into aquatic ecosystems and enhanced emissions of carbon dioxide and methane to the atmosphere. • the concurrence of heat waves with drought and high uv-b irradiance (280-315 nm) may negatively affect food security and biodiversity of crops and animals. these climatic conditions can disrupt formerly favourable habitats and may shift habitats to locations with different conditions, to which plants and animals may not be adapt. tropical coral reefs under naturally high uv irradiance are of particular concern, since an increase in sea surface temperatures of 1 °c to 2 °c can cause bleaching of corals, enhanced by high amounts of uv radiation. 2 human health • exposure to uv radiation has multiple harms and benefits. harms include skin cancer, inflammatory skin disorders, sunburn, and eye disorders such as cataract. benefits include production of vitamin d, reduced autoimmune disease and, possibly, lowered blood pressure and decreased risk of metabolic disorders. • the montreal protocol has resulted in significant reductions in uv-related diseases. the united states environmental protection agency has estimated that, due to the montreal protocol, 11 million cases of melanoma, 432 million cases of keratinocyte skin cancers, and 63 million cases of cataract will have been avoided for those born between 1890 and 2100 in the united states. 4\n",

            "highlights • the montreal protocol may have benefits for uv-induced inflammatory skin disorders. in some people these lead to large decreases in quality of life. many diuretic and anti-inflammatory drugs can cause photosensitivity when skin is exposed to uv radiation, although the global incidence of drug-induced photosensitivity is unclear. some drugs used for decreasing blood pressure may increase the risk of keratinocyte skin cancer through uv-induced dna damage. • by avoiding large increases in the uv index, the montreal protocol may have enabled people, especially those with light skin, to spend time outdoors without incurring sunburn, thereby gaining the benefits of sun exposure. one of these benefits is the generation of vitamin d in the skin. vitamin d plays an important role in maintaining musculoskeletal health, and there is increasing evidence of benefits for diseases related to immune function, including autoimmune diseases (e.g., multiple sclerosis), infection, and for cardiovascular disease, cancer mortality, and all-cause mortality. • decreases in uv radiation under the montreal protocol may have resulted in a lower rate at which pathogens are inactivated, including the sars-cov-2 virus responsible for covid-19. however, the positive outcomes of the montreal protocol outweigh any potential advantage for disinfection by higher amounts of solar uv radiation. 3 role of uv radiation in the troposphere • outdoor air pollution (e.g., from sulfate, nitrate, ozone, and particulate matter) results in ca 4 million premature deaths per year, and also damages vegetation and crops. • increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases are partly responsible for enhanced atmospheric circulation resulting in a downward transport of additional ozone (‘good’ uv-b-absorbing ozone) from the stratosphere to the troposphere (‘bad’ ozone, part of smog). • in the troposphere (the layer of the atmosphere extending from the earth’s surface to a height of 8-15 km), uv-b radiation generates the cleaning agent of the atmosphere, the hydroxyl radical (oh). this radical removes many compounds released by human activity and natural sources, such as carbon monoxide, methane, and hfos, hfcs and hcfcs1 (widely used as refrigerants). hfcs and hcfcs have high global warming potential contributing to climate change. when broken down by hydroxyl radicals, these compounds can form halogenated chemicals, including trifluoroacetic acid (tfa). • tfa has a long environmental lifetime, accumulates in surface and ground waters, and has been found in blood, drinking water, beverages, dust, plants, and agricultural soils. however, it does not interact with biological molecules and, due to its high solubility in water, it does not bioaccumulate. it is unlikely to cause adverse effects in terrestrial and aquatic organisms. continued monitoring and assessment are nevertheless advised due to uncertainties in the deposition of tfa and its potential effects on marine organisms. • uv radiation also plays a key role in creating harmful photochemical smog by reacting with pollutants such as nitrogen oxides, and volatile organic compounds (e.g., fuel, solvent vapours) mostly from industry and transport. even low concentrations of pollutants are detrimental to human health, prompting the world health organization to recommend average annual decreases in key air pollutants, including halving the maximum current level (10 µg/m3) of small particulate matter to 5 µg/m3, and that of nitrogen dioxide from 40 to 10 µg/m3. 4 global challenges of increasing plastic debris in the environment • many materials, including plastics, are susceptible to solar uv radiation, high temperature, and moisture, resulting in degradation, loss in strength, discolouration, decreased service life and environmental pollution due to the release of potentially environmentally harmful by-products. uv-stabilisers and other additives are being used to counteract photodegradation and release of toxic byproducts. • uv-degradation of plastics leads to generation of microplastics (<5 mm) and nanoplastics (<0.001 mm), which have been found in ecosystems, bottled drinking water, table salt, seafood, and wastewater. microfibres, including textile fibre fragments, are common contaminants of the environment. however, the biological effects of microand nanoplastics remain uncertain. • new uv-stabilisation technologies that block uv radiation through treatment of textiles with certain oxide nanoparticles (e.g., zinc oxide, titanium oxide), are being developed for next-generation synthetic (e.g., polyester fabric) and natural textiles (e.g. cotton fabric). a sustainable future requires continued adherence to the montreal protocol, with particular attention paid to mitigation of climate change, since recovery of stratospheric ozone is highly dependent on changes in greenhouse gas emissions and atmospheric concentrations of ozone-depleting substances, which will also determine future uv radiation at the earth’s surface. 1 ods replacements: hfcs, hydrofluorocarbons; hcfcs, hydrochlorofluorocarbons; hfos,

            "preface preface background the montreal protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer was established 35 years ago following the 1985 vienna convention for protection of the environment and human health against excessive amounts of harmful ultraviolet-b (uv-b, 280-315 nm) radiation reaching the earth’s surface due to a reduced uv-b-absorbing ozone layer. the montreal protocol, ratified globally by all 198 parties (countries), controls ca 100 ozone-depleting substances (ods). these substances have been used in many applications, such as in refrigerants, air conditioners, aerosol propellants, fumigants against pests, fire extinguishers, and foam materials. the montreal protocol has phased out nearly 99% of ods, including ods with high global warming potentials such as chlorofluorocarbons (cfc), thus serving a dual purpose. however, some of the replacements for ods also have high global warming potentials, for example, the hydrofluorocarbons (hfcs). several of these replacements have been added to the substances controlled by the montreal protocol. the hfcs are now being phased down under the kigali amendment. as of december 2022, 145 countries have signed the kigali amendment, exemplifying key additional outcomes of the montreal protocol, namely, that of also curbing climate warming and stimulating innovations to increase energy efficiency of cooling equipment used industrially as well as domestically. as the concentrations of ods decline in the upper atmosphere, the stratospheric ozone layer is projected to recover to pre-1980 levels by the middle of the 21st century, assuming full compliance with the control measures of the montreal protocol. however, in the coming decades, the ozone layer will be increasingly influenced by emissions of greenhouse gases and ensuing global warming. these trends are highly likely to modify the amount of uv radiation reaching the earth's surface with implications for the effects on ecosystems and human health. role of the assessment panels against this background, four panels of experts were established in 1988 to support and advise the parties to the montreal protocol with up-to-date information to facilitate decisions for protecting the stratospheric ozone layer. in 1990 the four panels were consolidated into three, the scientific assessment panel, the environmental effects assessment panel, and the technology and economic assessment panel. every four years, each of the panels provides their quadrennial assessments as well as a synthesis report that summarises the key findings of all the panels. in the in-between years leading up to the quadrennial, the panels continue to inform the parties to the montreal protocol of new scientific information. the environmental effects assessment panel the environmental effects assessment panel (eeap) evaluates the consequences of stratospheric ozone depletion in the context of a changing global climate in line with its terms of reference (decision xxxi/2, november 2019) and within the framework of the united nations sustainable development goals (sdgs). the eeap also alerts the parties to additional areas of potential importance to the montreal protocol. the 2022 quadrennial assessment focusses on the following: interactive effects of stratospheric ozone and climate change on: 1. solar ultraviolet radiation 2. human health 3. covid-19 and the montreal protocol 4. terrestrial ecosystems and biogeochemical cycles 5. aquatic ecosystems 6. composition of the troposphere and air quality 7. natural and synthetic materials 8. microplastics in the environment 6\n",

            " box 1. the unep environmental effects assessment panel (eeap) and its terms of reference. • the eeap is one of the three assessment panels established by the montreal protocol to assess various aspects of stratospheric ozone depletion ( the eeap considers the full range of potential effects of stratospheric ozone depletion, uv radiation and the interactive effects of climate change on human health, aquatic, terrestrial ecosystems, biogeochemical cycles (e.g., movement and transformation of carbon and other elements through the biosphere and atmosphere), air quality, and materials for construction, and other uses. • the terms of reference of the eeap, according to decision xxxi/2, meeting of the parties to the montreal protocol, are as follows: • the parties to the montreal protocol request the environmental effects assessment panel, in drafting its 2022 report, to pay particular attention to the most recent scientific information together with future projections and scenarios, to assess the effects from changes in the ozone layer and ultraviolet radiation, and their interaction with the climate system, as well as the effects of breakdown products of controlled substances and their alternatives on: 1. the biosphere, biodiversity and ecosystem health, including on biogeochemical processes and global cycles; 2. human health; 3. ecosystem services, agriculture, materials for construction, transport, and photovoltaic use, as well as the generation of environmental microplastics. the findings in the 2022 quadrennial assessment, which are summarised here, demonstrate that the montreal protocol continues to play a vital role in preserving human health and maintaining healthy, diverse ecosystems on land and in the water. new findings refine and quantify the negative consequences on human health and ecosystem productivity of extreme levels of solar uv-b radiation that would have occurred without the montreal protocol. however, other findings show that in regions of the earth that are not currently experiencing appreciable ozone depletion (i.e., outside polar regions), levels of solar uv-b radiation can have some beneficial effects. for example, beneficial effects may include those for human health, crop vigour and defence against pests and pathogens, food quality, and important ecosystem services, such as the disinfection of surface waters and the breakdown of environmental toxins and contaminants. evidence that climate change is playing an increasingly important role in altering the exposure to uv radiation of organisms, ecosystems, and materials continues to mount. changes in exposure to uv radiation are occurring through changes in extreme climate events2 , cloud cover, aerosols, snow and ice cover, mixing of ocean waters, species distributions, the seasonal patterns of growth and development (phenology), and human behaviour. 2 ultraviolet radiation and climate change the montreal protocol continues to play a critical role in protecting the stratospheric ozone layer and climate, and in preventing large increases in surface uv-b radiation. while uv-b irradiances remain high under the antarctic ozone hole, changes in uv-b radiation outside polar regions over the past several decades have been small. however, substantial interannual variability in stratospheric ozone and uv-b radiation are occurring due to changes in climate caused by increases in atmospheric greenhouse gases (ghgs). despite large year-to-year variability, recovery of the antarctic ozone hole by the middle of this century is still projected. future changes in stratospheric ozone and uv-b irradiance outside polar regions are expected to be small. recent anomalous changes in stratospheric ozone over polar regions, particularly over antarctica, have likely contributed to extreme events, such as heat waves and wildfires, in the southern hemisphere. the elevated uv-b radiation together with these extreme events have the potential to significantly affect organisms and ecosystems in polar regions, especially as the climate continues to change. 2 an extreme climate event has been defined as “an episode or occurrence in which a statistically rare or unusual climatic period alters ecosystem structure and ⁄or function well outside the bounds of what is considered typical or normal variability” [8]; or similarly, according to the intergovernmental panel on climate change (ipcc), “if the value of a variable exceeds (or lies below) a threshold” that is exceeded [9]. compound extreme events are the “combination of multiple drivers and/or hazards that contribute to societal or environmental risk.” an example of a compound extreme event would be fire weather conditions which are the combination of hot, dry, and windy conditions [9]. 13\n",
            "\n",
            " key findings • nearly all studies published since our last quadrennial assessment have confirmed that changes in biologically effective uv radiation at the earth’s surface outside polar regions have been small (< 4% per decade) during the last 25 years. some locations showed small increases in the uv index (uvi3 ), while others showed small decreases. over the last 2–3 decades, changes in the erythemal uv radiation outside the polar regions were mainly governed by variations in clouds, aerosols, and surface reflectivity (for areas usually covered by snow or ice) rather than long-term trends in total column ozone. • the antarctic ozone hole has resulted in large increases in surface uv-b radiation, with peak irradiances sometimes exceeding those observed in subtropical locations. results from an updated analysis [10] confirm previous conclusions that the antarctic ozone hole has led to large increases in the uvi at palmer station, antarctica (64° s) year-round, with the largest increases occurring during spring (between 15 september and 15 november) (fig. 1). during spring, the maximum uvi that has been observed at this site since the early 1990s is 2.5 times higher than it was in the pre-ozone-hole period (years 1970-1976) and sometimes exceeds values observed at subtropical locations (e.g., san diego, california; 32° n). during summer and autumn (21 december – 21 june; the time of the year when there is no ozone hole); uvi maxima measured between 1990 and 2020 exceeded maxima estimated for years prior to 1976 by 20%. 16 14 12 10 8 6 4 2 0 j a s o n d j f m a m j southern hemisphere month 3 the uv index is a measure of uv irradiance in terms of its effectiveness in causing sunburn (reddening of human skin; medically known as erythema). 14 xednivumumixam northern hemisphere month j f m a m j j a s o n d winter spring summer autumn sandiego difference dueto ozone depletion palmer pointbarrow maximumuvindexforeachdayoftheyear . pre-ozonehole sinceearly1990s.

            "\n",
            " • large inter-annual variability in the uv index over polar regions has been observed in recent years. for example, in spring 2019, the uvi was at the minimum of the historical (1991–2018) range at the south pole, while near record-high values, of up to 80% above the historical mean, were observed in spring 2020 (fig. 2). a persistent antarctic ozone hole in 2020 resulted in spikes in the uvi (red arrow in fig. 2) in late spring when young animals are born or hatched and when plants are actively growing. the loss of protective snow cover, due to continued global warming, could further exacerbate the deleterious effects of these high spring-time uv irradiances on organisms in this region [11]. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 1-sep 1-oct 1-nov 1-dec 1-jan month 15 xedni vu mumixam yliad arrival heights, antarctica (78 s, 167 e) 1989–2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 fig. 2. daily maximum uv index (uvi) measured at arrival heights, antarctica in 2018 (green), 2019 (yellow), 2020 (red), and 2021 (blue) compared with the average (white line) and the range (grey shading) of daily maximum observations of the years indicated in the legends. the uvi was calculated from spectra measured by a suv-100 spectroradiometer. up to 2009, the instrument was part of the nsf uv monitoring network [12] and it is now a node in the noaa antarctic uv monitoring network ( consistent data processing methods were applied for all years [13,14]. • recent warming and widespread heatwave events in antarctica may have increased the exposure of plants and animals to uv-b radiation and disrupted ecosystems in this region. since our last assessment there have been two widespread heatwave events in antarctica. the first occurred in summer 2019/2020 when temperature records were broken around the continent [15]. the second was in march 2022 (austral autumn) when extreme temperatures, almost 40 ˚c higher than normal (-48.6° c), were reported when an atmospheric river, or plume of warm, moist air, moved onto the antarctic plateau. heatwaves such as these accelerate melting of snow and ice cover [16] and can expose vegetation to high springtime uv-b radiation from which they have previously been protected [17]. warming temperatures on the antarctic peninsula are also opening up ice-free areas [16], causing the expansion of habitats of vascular plants [18] and increasing the possibility of new plant and animal species invading the continent [19,20]. • in the arctic, some of the highest uv-b irradiances on record were measured in march and april 2020. the monthly average uvi over the canadian arctic in march 2020 was up to 70% higher than the historical (2005–2019) average, often exceeding this mean by three standard deviations. because most arctic organisms are protected by snow and sea ice at this time of year, they likely were not exposed to these high uv-b irradiances; however, changes in snow and ice cover resulting from climate change could expose these organisms to elevated uv-b radiation if these pronounced ozone depletion events continue to occur into the future. • recent ozone depletion events in the arctic have been linked to extreme weather events and melting of sea ice in this region. heatwave conditions that occurred in the siberian arctic in early 2020 [21] appeared to have been aided by atmospheric circulation patterns that were affected by the strong ozone depletion of 2020 [22,23]. ozone depletion in march 2020 may also have contributed to the prevailing reduction of sea ice in the arctic ocean bordering siberia [24]. • the montreal protocol has prevented large increases in surface uv-b radiation, with greatest benefits at high latitudes. modelling studies indicate that without the montreal protocol, the uvi at northern and southern latitudes of less than 50° would have increased by 10–20% between 1996 and 2020. for latitudes exceeding 50° s, the uvi would have increased by 25% at the southern tip of south america and by more than 100% at the south pole in spring-time (fig. 3).\n",

[25]. 3 human health exposure to excessive uv radiation can result in a number of deleterious effects on human health, including skin cancer (fig. 5) and cataract. however, it is estimated that millions of cases of these diseases have been avoided due to the montreal protocol. moderate exposure to uv radiation can have some beneficial effects on human health, most notably the production of vitamin d. it is likely that by avoiding large increases in uv-b radiation, the montreal protocol has allowed humans to safely tolerate time outdoors, thereby gaining the benefits of sun exposure. this may have reduced the risk or severity of several diseases, particularly those related to immune function, such as multiple sclerosis. solar uv radiation may also have played a role in inactivating the virus responsible for the covid-19 pandemic (sars-cov-2) and in influencing people’s immune system responses to viral infection. however, available evidence suggests it to be unlikely that the montreal protocol has had a major effect on the covid-19 pandemic. key findings • modelling studies indicate that the montreal protocol is contributing to the prevention of skin cancer. results from an updated study [26] indicate that the montreal protocol will have prevented millions of cases of skin cancers (melanoma and keratinocyte cancers) in the united states for people born between 1890 – 2100 (table 1). the model estimated that people born in 2040 or later will not experience excess risk of skin cancer caused by the effect of ozone depletion on uv-b radiation, assuming continued compliance with the montreal protocol. while this study highlights the critical importance of the montreal protocol, an important limitation is that these estimates assume no changes in sun exposure behaviour, skin screening or population structure, such as in the distribution of skin types. other limitations include uncertainty regarding stratospheric ozone trends and the choice of the action spectrum for dna damage. 17\n",

            " fig. 5. skin cancer resulting from exposure to uv radiation occurs primarily as a consequence of direct and indirect (via reactive oxygen species) dna damage and immune suppression. • the incidence of malignant melanoma continues to increase in many developed countries, but trends vary with population and age. incidence has increased in some countries (e.g., united kingdom, sweden, canada, norway, france, and lithuania), but declined or stabilised in others (e.g., hungary, australia, and denmark) [27-32]. in canada, italy and england the incidence of melanoma increased in older age groups but declined or stabilised in younger age groups [33-35]. the increases in the rates of skin cancer in older age groups are most likely the result of high lifetime sun exposure, rather than to changes in stratospheric ozone. the stabilising or decreasing incidence in younger age groups in some jurisdictions may reflect migration patterns, increased use of sun protection strategies, and a social shift in occupational and recreational activities from outdoors to indoors. in the absence of the montreal protocol, these declines may not have been observed. • keratinocyte skin cancers are the most common cancer in the world and pose a significant burden on human health and economies. keratinocyte skin cancers (kc) include basal cell carcinoma (bcc) and squamous cell carcinoma (scc). an analysis of global burden of disease (gbd) data found that in 2019 kc was the most common cancer globally, affecting almost 3 times as many people as the next most common cancer (lung, 2.2 million people) [36,37]. death due to bcc is very rare, but ~56,000 people died due to scc. the burden of disease, as measured by disability-adjusted life years (dalys), increased by almost 25% between 2010 and 2019. the incidence of kc has increased in many locations, including australia, new zealand, iceland, and the united kingdom, but in the united states the incidence remained fairly stable from 2005 to 2019. the lifetime risk of kc is much higher in populations living in conditions with high ambient uv radiation; for example, the lifetime risk is 3.5 times higher in australia than in the united kingdom [38,39]. the cost of kc in terms of medical treatment and lost worker productivity is very high and increasing. for example, the average paid and unpaid productivity loss per premature death from melanoma in europe are the second highest of all cancers, and in the united states between 1997 and 2015, total expenditure for treatment of melanoma increased at a faster rate than for other cancers. in australia, skin cancer (kc and melanoma combined) costs more to treat than any other cancer. these high costs point to the potential economic benefits of the montreal protocol with respect to skin cancer prevention. • solar uv radiation causes or worsens inflammatory skin disorders (photodermatoses) and can contribute to phototoxicity of certain medications. photodermatoses are inflammatory skin disorders that are induced or exacerbated by exposure to uv radiation (uv-b and uv-a radiation) and sometimes visible radiation. these disorders can lead to substantial decreases in the quality of life, due both to the morbidity associated with the conditions and to the reduction in work and recreational activities that are needed to manage these conditions. a considerable number of common oral medications (e.g., diuretics and anti-inflammatory drugs) [40] exhibit photosensitising potential, whereby individuals exposed to sufficient doses of these drugs together with uv radiation can experience skin reddening, swelling and burning. photosensitising drugs may increase the risk of skin cancer through uv-induced dna damage, but further studies are required to adequately assess this risk. • modelling studies indicate that the montreal protocol will reduce the incidence of cataract. long-term exposure of eyes to uv radiation can cause cataract, which is the leading cause of blindness world-wide [41-45]. access to care is the main determinant of vision loss due to cataract, and individuals living in regions with high ambient uv radiation and limited access to care (such as in parts of asia, oceania and sub-saharan africa) experience above average incidences of moderate to severe vision impairment [41,43,45]. in the united states, model estimates indicate that the montreal protocol will prevent 63 million cases of cataract for individuals born between 1890 – 2100 (table 1). 18\n",

mortality estimates are rounded to the nearest hundred thousand. totals may not sum due to independent rounding. • exposing the skin and eyes to solar radiation leads to the production of vitamin d, modulates the immune system, and can have other beneficial effects on health. the best known benefit of exposing the skin to the sun, and in particular uv-b radiation, is production of vitamin d. vitamin d is essential for maintaining musculoskeletal health but recent findings also indicate that low levels of 25-hydroxy vitamin d (25(oh)d), the molecule measured to assess vitamin d status, may also be associated with increased risk of a range of health outcomes, including multiple sclerosis [46], respiratory tract infections [47], and coronary heart disease [48]. separately from vitamin d, exposing the skin to uv radiation modulates the immune system, both locally within the skin and at distant body sites. this has dual effects, increasing the risk of skin cancer, but downregulating inflammation. there is emerging evidence that uv-a radiation (and possibly uv-b), can release nitric oxide from the skin with benefits for blood pressure and metabolism. exposing the eyes to the sun reduces the risk of short-sightedness. balancing the risks and benefits of sun exposure is challenging. in the absence of the montreal protocol the high uv indices that would have occurred would have caused skin damage in a very short time, limiting the time people could spend outdoors and reducing the benefits of sun exposure. • solar uv radiation can inactivate sars-cov-2, the virus responsible for covid-19, but the montreal protocol has likely had a minimal effect on covid-19 transmission. a newly-developed action spectrum indicates that both uv-b and uv-a radiation can inactivate the sars-cov-2 virus [49]. estimates of the exposure time required for virus inactivation vary among studies, but the most reliable data suggest that 90% of viral particles embedded in saliva are inactivated within ca. 7 minutes by solar radiation under optimal high-sun conditions, as would occur under clear skies near midday during summer at midto low latitudes. longer exposures to solar uv radiation (exceeding ~13 minutes) would be required for inactivation early or late in the day during winter at higher latitudes [50-52]. slightly longer inactivation times were found for aerosolised virus particles, and inactivation times would be longer for cloudy conditions or if virus particles are shielded from solar radiation. as the primary mode of transmission of this virus from person to person appears to occur through respiratory droplets and aerosols generated by breathing, sneezing, and coughing in crowded indoor conditions [53-57], disinfection by uv radiation of outdoor surfaces is unlikely to have played a significant part in controlling covid-19. • exposure to ambient levels of solar uv radiation may contribute to a reduced incidence or severity of covid-19, but causal mechanisms are unclear and uncertainty is high. a number of studies have shown that the incidence or severity of covid-19 is inversely related to ambient solar uv radiation (i.e., fewer cases and less severe covid-19 with greater intensity of uv radiation), but there are many possible confounding factors (e.g., other environmental factors such as temperature, humidity and total solar radiation, as well as factors affecting viral transmission and disease management). the causal nature of these relationships is therefore unclear. some studies have found inverse associations between vitamin d (25(oh)d) concentration in the blood and the risk of sarscov-2 positivity or severity of covid-19. if vitamin d is found to be causally associated with covid-19 risk or outcomes, or if other effects of uv radiation on the immune system are important, extreme care would be required to balance these beneficial effects of sun exposure against the risks of sunburn and skin cancer in people with light skin. in general, the far-reaching, positive outcomes of the implementation of the montreal protocol for human health outweigh any potential advantage that might have been gained by the effects of solar uv radiation on the transmission and severity of covid-19 that would have occurred in the absence of the montreal protocol. perhaps most importantly, the montreal protocol has avoided large increases in uv-b radiation that would likely have caused people to spend less time outdoors, and more time indoors where the risk of covid-19 infection is much higher. 19\n",

            " 4 terrestrial ecosystems and biogeochemical cycles changes in uv radiation and climate interact to affect terrestrial ecosystems and biogeochemical cycles (i.e., the cycling of nutrients such as carbon and nitrogen), with potential consequences for food security, biodiversity, and climate. exposure to extreme solar uv radiation, as would have occurred without the montreal protocol, would have had pronounced deleterious effects on many plants, animals, and microorganisms. however, most species in terrestrial environments have evolved mechanisms to tolerate or avoid the harmful effects of solar uv radiation, at least at levels within the range experienced without significant ozone depletion. nonetheless, these moderate levels of solar uv radiation together with climate change can affect the productivity and biodiversity of terrestrial ecosystems, including agroecosystems, by altering food quality, plant defence against pests and pathogens, plant vigour and tolerances to other abiotic stresses, and the photodegradation of plant litter and pesticides. importantly, the photodegradation of plant litter by uv and short-wavelength visible radiation can enhance decomposition and nutrient cycling, resulting in emission of ghgs, such as carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide, with positive feedbacks on the climate system. key findings • extreme climate events are becoming more prevalent with climate change, and these events are likely to alter the exposure of organisms to uv radiation and disrupt terrestrial ecosystems. globally, stronger storms, catastrophic floods, protracted droughts, anomalous heat waves, more intense wildfires, and other extreme climate events (eces5) are causing long-term disruption to the structure and function of many terrestrial ecosystems [58,59]. together with changes in cloud cover and aerosols, these eces are likely altering the uv radiation received by terrestrial organisms outside polar regions to a greater degree than current or projected changes in stratospheric ozone concentrations (fig. 6). while these alterations in solar uv irradiation have the potential to affect biodiversity, productivity, emissions of ghgs [60-62], and ecosystem carbon storage [63], the magnitude of these impacts are unknown at the present time. • ongoing changes in climate are exposing plants to new combinations of uv radiation and other environmental factors that can affect stress tolerances and food quality. a combination of particular concern is high uv-b irradiance and drought, as climate change is increasing the frequency and severity of drought. drought periods frequently coincide with high uv radiation, particularly at mid to low latitudes [9]. because of shared molecular pathways in stress tolerance mechanisms, the response of plants to moderate levels of uv radiation may confer some cross-protection against drought [64,65]. this cross-tolerance might mitigate some of the detrimental effects of drought on crop growth and yield, unless both stress factors are excessive. uv radiation and climate factors can also interact to have both positive and negative effects on nutritional quality of food, depending on type of crop and environmental conditions [66]. fig 6. pathways by which extreme climate events (eces) driven by changes in stratospheric ozone and climate can affect uv radiation exposure and terrestrial organisms and ecosystems. changes in stratospheric ozone and climate interact to influence the frequency and intensity of a number of eces (upper-most grey rectangles). these eces in turn affect atmospheric and surface intermediaries (multi-coloured ovals connected with eces by overlapping shaded regions) which can increase (+) or decrease (-) the solar uv radiation reaching terrestrial organisms and ecosystems. solid arrows show direct mediation by climate, ozone and uv radiation on eces and potential interactive and feedback effects. dashed arrows show chronic effects of climate change factors. 5 an extreme climate event has been defined as “an episode or occurrence in which a statistically rare or unusual climatic period alters ecosystem structure and ⁄or function well outside the bounds of what is considered typical or normal variability” [8]; or similarly, according to the intergovernmental panel on climate change (ipcc), “if the value of a variable exceeds (or lies below) a threshold” that is exceeded [9]. compound extreme events are the “combination of multiple drivers and/or hazards that contribute to societal or environmental risk.” an example of a compound extreme event would be fire weather conditions which are the combination of hot, dry, and windy conditions [9]. 20\n",

            " • certain crops, especially those grown in the tropics and montane environments, may be vulnerable to relatively small increases in uv-b radiation. because of shifting bioclimatic zones with climate change, certain crops are being grown at higher elevations than was previously possible [e.g., 67,68]. for some species of crop plants, especially those grown in the tropics, the intense uv radiation at higher elevations may exceed their uv tolerances, resulting in damage to dna and proteins with negative consequences for their physiology and growth [69]. as crop species are grown in new habitats, they also encounter new weeds, pests, and pathogens [70,71]. exposure to uv radiation is known to influence competition between plants and defence against herbivores [72,73] such that the altered uv radiation conditions may further disrupt the structure and function of these agroecosystems by affecting interactions of crop plants with weeds and pests. differential effects of climate change on range shifts and phenology can also lead to spatial and/or temporal or seasonal mismatches between pollinators and their plant hosts [74,75], posing a risk to both agroecosystem function and food security. • climate change can contribute to declines in biodiversity by reducing the availability of suitable habitats for species and by shifting their distribution ranges, which alters exposure to uv radiation and may disrupt species interactions. plant and animal species are migrating and shifting their distribution ranges to higher elevations and latitudes in response to on-going changes in climate [76-78], and these changes can decrease (poleward shifts) or increase (elevational shifts) exposures to solar uv radiation. some models suggest that uv radiation can interact with climate change to influence species distributions, although the mechanisms underlying these effects are unclear. nonetheless, changes in uv irradiances resulting from these shifts will likely modify plant growth forms and secondary chemistry (e.g., flavonoids and other phenolic compounds), which may affect the competitive ability of plants and their defence against herbivores [79,72]. depending on location, these changes in species interactions have the potential to negatively affect biodiversity [80]. • solar uv radiation can accelerate the decomposition of dead plant matter (litter) in many terrestrial ecosystems with implications for carbon storage and climate. the decomposition of plant litter is a key biogeochemical process determining rates of nutrient cycling, energy flow, and carbon storage in terrestrial ecosystems. exposure of litter to solar uv radiation and shortwavelength visible radiation (i.e., blue and green light), can increase rates of litter decomposition via the direct photochemical breakdown of lignin and other plant cell wall constituents (i.e., photomineralisation), and indirectly, by enhancing microbial decomposition (i.e., photofacilitation). photodegradation of litter is now recognised to be important in a wide variety of ecosystems across a range of climatic regions (e.g., deserts, grasslands, forests), although the relative importance of photomineralisation vs photofacilitation may differ among habitats [81]. a newly developed action spectrum for photomineralisation indicates that uv-a is more effective than uv-b radiation in driving this process. thus, ozone depletion likely has minimal effect on this aspect of photodegradation [82]. photodegradation influences the cycling and storage of carbon as well as other elements (e.g., nitrogen and phosphorous) and can be an important pathway of ghg emissions by terrestrial ecosystems [83,84]. • thawing of permafrost is destabilising arctic ecosystems and exposing ancient sources of organic carbon to photodegradation by solar uv radiation. the world’s soils store large amounts of carbon, approximately two-to-three times more than the atmosphere (fig. 7a). therefore, even small instabilities or degradation of soils driven by perturbations in climate can lead to large releases of carbon. a large proportion of soil carbon is stored at high northern latitudes, where it has remained stable in peatlands and permafrost soils over long time periods, often many thousands of years. as climate warms, permafrost is thawing [85], leading to the decomposition of this ancient organic matter and the release of carbon dioxide, methane and other ghgs. the organic matter from thawed permafrost soils enters aquatic ecosystems as dissolved organic matter (dom) where it becomes susceptible to photodegradation by solar uv radiation [86]. reductions in ice and snow or changes in vegetation and cloud cover are further modifying exposures to uv irradiation, which affect the magnitude of these photodegradation processes and arctic organisms (fig. 7b). • photodegradation of dissolved organic matter by uv radiation in aquatic ecosystems releases greenhouse gases that may exacerbate climate change. climate change is enhancing terrestrial runoff rich in dissolved organic matter (dom) to lakes, rivers, and coastal waters, which increases the amount of dom that is subjected to photodegradation. another important source of dom is the permafrost soils of the northern hemisphere (fig. 7). emissions of co resulting from photodegradation of dom at mid-latitudes 2 are generally negligible compared to emissions from microbial mineralisation of dom but may play a large role at high latitudes. the magnitude of the direct abiotic photochemical degradation (i.e., photomineralisation) of dom in arctic watersheds rich in yedoma (organic-rich permafrost, [87]) is still uncertain, with estimates ranging from negligible [88-90] to 75–90% of total co emissions [912 93]. understanding how dom photoreactivity varies across seasons and with water chemistry is crucial to predicting the extent of photochemical co emissions in high latitude ecosystems and their variations induced by changes in climate and uv radiation. 2 21\n",

            " fig. 8. schematic depiction of processes controlling exposure to uv-b radiation in aquatic ecosystems comparing before and after the anthropocene (i.e., the current period of significant human impact on the earth’s ecosystems). in general, exposure to uv-b radiation is limited to the surface layer (light blue/brown), the mixing of which depends on the stratifying effect of surface warming and inputs of fresh water vs the stirring effects of surface winds and currents. ice cover shields the polar ocean and wintertime lakes (not shown). in oceans in the anthropocene, generally there is more warming, more wind, and a greater mixed layer depth (mld), while sharpening the density barrier (pycnocline, dark blue) to nutrient transport (arrows) from deep water (black). however, ice melt reduces shielding and freshens the polar ocean reducing the mld. terrestrial run-off from rain events browns lake surface water, lowers transparency to uv-b radiation and warms surface waters due to enhanced absorption of solar radiation. drought would have the opposite effect. the warming results in shallower mixed layers in lakes, as do weaker winds. dimensions are not to scale. • anthropogenic factors in combination with uv radiation are exacerbating stresses on aquatic ecosystems, especially tropical coral reef ecosystems. tropical coral reefs, which are based on the symbiotic association between reef-building corals and symbiotic dinoflagellates (family symbiodiniaceae), are highly diverse and economically important ecosystems that are naturally exposed to high levels of uv radiation because they occur in clear, tropical waters close to the surface. findings from some studies indicate that exposure to uv-b radiation can have detrimental effects on symbionts, although negative effects are often not evident on the coral host [97]. stress on symbionts can lead to their expulsion from the coral host and coral bleaching. these negative effects on symbiont health are a concern as coral bleaching is becoming more common as sea surface waters continue to warm and become more acidic. these effects may exacerbate the impact of uv-b radiation on coral ecosystems. coral reefs may also be vulnerable to oil pollutants and chemicals from sunscreens, the toxic effects of which can be enhanced by uv-b radiation and climate change [98,99] (fig. 9). 23\n",

            " fig 9. coral reef-dwelling organisms, such as reef-building corals, are affected by stressors such as warming of sea surface waters and by contaminants such as oil and uv filters (e.g., sunscreens). in near-surface waters, corals are also exposed to high levels of uv radiation, the potentially damaging effects of which are moderated by photoprotection mechanisms. nevertheless, the negative impacts of stressors and contaminants are exacerbated by co-exposure to uv-a and uv-b radiation. photo: sandra mendoza quiroz. • solar uv radiation degrades oil pollutants but enhances their toxicity to aquatic organisms. recent studies have confirmed that solar uv radiation is a key factor contributing to the removal of pollutants from oil spills (reviewed by [100]). for example, during the 102 days of the deepwater horizon spill, uv-driven production of water soluble organic carbon (also referred to as photo-dissolution) accounted for about 8% (estimated range: 3-17%) of overall oil removal, an amount comparable to other widely acknowledged removal processes (evaporation and coastal stranding) [101]. exposure to high amounts of uv radiation can also increase the toxicity of some oil components for corals, sponges, molluscs, polychaetes, and crustaceans [99]. typically, exposure to uv radiation has not been a part of oil toxicity studies, but these results suggest that including such exposures in future studies would improve our understanding of the fate and toxicity of oil spills occurring at or near the ocean’s surface [102]. 6 air quality and contaminants solar uv radiation is a major contributor to the formation of air pollution (tropospheric ozone (o ) and some particulate matter 3 (pm)), which has been identified as a critical issue in human health world-wide. however, uv radiation also plays a role in cleansing the atmosphere of pollutants, and air pollution can affect the penetration of uv radiation to the earth’s surface. thus, changes in stratospheric ozone and climate can have complex and sometimes opposing effects on different types of air pollution. solar uv radiation also plays an important role in the breakdown of contaminants in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, but the ecological and human health consequences of these transformations are not yet well understood. contamination of the environment by compounds used to replace ods remains a concern. key findings • solar uv radiation, particularly uv-b radiation, can worsen tropospheric air quality with appreciable harmful effects on human health. globally, poor outdoor air quality causes extensive morbidity and over 4 million premature deaths per year related to respiratory, cardiovascular, reproductive and neurological disorders. improvements in some aspects of air quality (e.g., pm) have occurred in some regions (e.g., china), because stringent measures to control pollution have led to long-term reductions in emissions of nitrogen oxides (nox) and sulfur dioxide (so )—necessary ingredients for the uv-driven formation of tropospheric o 2 3 and pm. decreases in uv-b radiation, as a result of the montreal protocol, would be expected to result in a reduced net production of o near sources of pollution (e.g., cities with large emissions of nox from traffic) and a slower consumption of o with increasing 3 3 distance from polluted areas. future scenarios in which stratospheric o returns to 1980 values or even exceeds them, could help 3 ameliorate urban o pollution but may worsen o pollution reaching rural areas. for pm, sensitivity to changes in uv radiation is 3 3 expected based on knowledge of the relevant photochemical processes, but has not been studied systematically and hence remains unquantified. 24\n",

            " • tropospheric ozone and particulate matter can have adverse effects on forests and the yields of crops in rural areas, with important economic consequences. tropospheric o is known to contribute to significant losses in growth, quality and yield of 3 crops and other plants, and recent studies have further quantified these effects. for example, a recent meta-analysis of 48 studies examining the effects of chronic tropospheric o exposure on soybeans conducted between 1980 and 2019 showed that o 3 3 reduced leaf-area by 21%, leaf, shoot and root biomass by 14%, 23% and 17%, respectively, and seed yield by 28% [103]. a study on the historical losses to air pollutants in maize and soybean grown in the united states showed that improvements in the control of o , so , pm, and no have increased yields by an average of 20% [104]. of these pollutants, pm and no appeared to cause 3 2 2 2 more damage than o and so . overall, the improvement in yields from stricter controls of the pollutants was equivalent to ca us$ 5 3 2 billion. • solar uv radiation also plays a major role in cleansing the troposphere of pollutants and greenhouse gases. uv-generated hydroxyl radicals (oh), the major cleaning agents of the troposphere, remove many atmospheric pollutants and ghgs (fig. 10). research has shown that increases in uv radiation caused by stratospheric ozone depletion over 1980-2020 have contributed a small increase (ca. 3%) to the concentration of globally averaged oh, alongside several other variables that affect oh (e.g., temperature, humidity, and increased emissions of precursors of tropospheric o ). hydroxyl radicals react with many environmentally important 3 chemicals including some ghgs (e.g., methane; ch ) and some odss, such as the so-called very-short-lived substances (vslss; 4 halo-organics with an atmospheric lifetime of less than or equal to 6 months). these reactions control both the lifetimes and the amounts of such chemicals in the atmosphere. for ch , the uv-related increase in oh is the equivalent of offsetting increases in the 4 concentration by 40 ppb or decreasing emissions by ~15 tg y-1. for the vslss, the changes in oh are part of a complex feedback (fig. 10) that is not yet fully quantified. fig. 10. interacting effects of uv-b radiation and tropospheric o 3 and water (h o) on tropospheric 2 concentrations of oh and on the lifetime of very-short-lived substances (vslss). effects of climate change include more frequent wildfires and thawing of permafrost soils with the formation of thermokarst lakes, which are important sources of co and ch , 4 respectively. increased emissions of co and ch tend to decrease the 4 tropospheric oh concentration, which in turn results in longer lifetime of vslss and thus a higher probability of stratospheric ozone depletion. • the increases in trifluoroacetic acid concentrations due to replacements of the ozone-depleting substances are not expected to pose significant risk to humans or the environment at the present time. trifluoroacetic acid (tfa) continues to be found in the environment, including in remote regions, although concentrations are so low that they are currently very unlikely to have adverse toxicological consequences for humans and ecosystems [105,106]. the accumulated amount of tfa is expected to increase because of the planned replacement of ods with short-lived fluorinated chemicals (fig. 11). however, based on projected future use of these precursors of tfa, no harm is anticipated. there is a large uncertainty associated with the magnitude of other sources of tfa (e.g., potential natural sources, fluorinated pesticides, and pharmaceuticals), which do not fall under the purview of the montreal protocol. trifluoroacetic acid has biological properties that differ significantly from the longer chain polyfluoroalkyl substances (pfas) and inclusion of tfa in this larger group of chemicals for regulation would be inconsistent with the risk assessment of tfa. 25\n",

            " key findings • more environmentally-friendly additives are being developed and used in plastics and wood to reduce the degradation of these materials by solar uv radiation. the recent trend towards development of environmentally sustainable technologies and building materials has necessitated the use of plant-based, non-toxic additives in coatings, plastics, and sunscreens [107-109]. in selecting additives, including uv-stabilisers [110], for plastics or coatings, increasing attention is being paid to minimising their potential ecotoxicity as these additives often leach out to contaminate the environment [111]. some wood extractives and lignin nanoparticles have been tested for their efficacy as uv shielding material against surface discolouration of wood. nanoparticles of lignin applied to coatings and even sunscreens have shown promise for substituting or complementing synthetic uv-absorbers. however, the undesirable dark colour of lignin is a drawback in lignin-based uv-shielding products and needs to be addressed. • new technologies are being developed to increase the lifespan of photovoltaic modules used in solar panels. polymers in photovoltaic (pv) modules undergo oxidation when exposed to solar uv irradiation and this causes brittleness, degradation and reduced lifetime of these systems [112-115] (fig. 12). while accelerated laboratory testing has improved understanding of the different degradation mechanisms in pv modules, accurate prediction of degradation of these systems in the outdoors and under actual in-use conditions is still lacking [116]. efforts to find a better replacement for the encapsulant material used in these systems has yielded several candidate polymers, such as ionomers and thermoplastic polyolefin [117]; and novel transparent backsheets designed to work specifically with bifacial pv cells and modules are being introduced. these modules will collect reflected sunlight on the back side of the module to increase power generation per unit area [118]. fig. 12. components of a crystalline silicon photovoltaic (pv) module illustrating encapsulants, backsheet, and junction box that are made of plastic materials, which are susceptible to degradation by solar uv radiation [119]. • solar uv radiation causes weathering of plastics, which ultimately results in fragmentation and the formation of microand nano-plastics. plastic debris in the environment is perceived as an increasing pollution problem with an estimated 8300 million metric tons being produced since the 1950s, of which ca 80% have ended in landfills and the natural environment [120]. in the natural environment, micro(<5 mm) and nano-plastics (<0.1 µm) are generated as a result of solar uv-driven weathering of plastic debris in combination with fragmentation due to exposure to mechanical forces [121] (fig. 13). exposure to solar uv radiation is a primary weathering mechanism of plastics debris. such photo-oxidation of plastic debris under extended outdoor exposure makes the material weak, brittle and prone to subsequent fragmentation [122,123]. fragmentation then occurs when plastics are subjected to factors such as wave action or encounters with animals, resulting in the generation of secondary microor nano-particles. while there are concerns about potential effects of microand nanoplastics, the risks of these pollutants to human health and the environment are at present unclear. nonetheless, there are calls for a global treaty on plastics towards a more sustainable future [124]. • the implementation of the montreal protocol, and consequent avoidance of high solar uv-b radiation, has likely prevented increases in the generation of microplastics in the environment. large increases in terrestrial solar uv-b radiation, which have been avoided by the montreal protocol, would have increased the rates of uv-driven photo-oxidation, and consequently fragmentation of plastic debris that produces microplastics. however, estimates of the impact of the montreal protocol on microplastic production are limited by uncertainties in the uv dose-response of photo-oxidative reactions, and the distribution of plastics within different environments (soil, water, etc.), which affect exposure to uv radiation. thus, while uv driven photo-oxidation of plastics, and subsequent fragmentation are well documented, the quantitative impact of this process on plastic longevity, microplastic generation, and ecological impacts remains unknown at present 27\n",

            " fig. 13. solar uv radiation can drive the photo-oxidation of plastics, making plastics susceptible to fragmentation, a process that may result in the formation of microand nano-plastic particles. plastic mineralisation has been reported, but the relevance of this process in the natural environment remains to be established. the climate has impacts on photo-oxidation through a variety of different routes, including direct effects on solar uv radiation, plastic dispersal, penetration of uv radiation through the water column, and rising temperatures. 8 conclusions the , together with the full quadrennial assessment, illustrate the diversity of ways that changes in stratospheric ozone, uv radiation and climate interact to affect human health and the environment. while exposure to solar uv radiation, and, in particular, uv-b radiation, can have deleterious effects on humans and other organisms, modest exposure to uv radiation can have beneficial effects on human health, food quality and plant defence against pests, the disinfection of waters, and the conversion of toxic contaminants to more benign by-products [125,60,126]. maintaining an optimal balance between the positive and negative effects of solar uv radiation would have been difficult to achieve, if not impossible, without the montreal protocol. evidence also continues to mount showing that the montreal protocol is directly and indirectly protecting the earth’s climate and mitigating some of the negative consequences of climate change [5,25]. since our last quadrennial assessment, the world has experienced continued increases in global temperatures, additional extreme climate events (eces, e.g., heat waves, droughts, and hurricanes) and events resulting from a combination of weather extremes and other drivers (e.g., wildfires) that have all contributed to increasing societal and environmental risk. as recently reported by the intergovernmental panel on climate change [9], eces are expected to increase in frequency and intensity in the future because of anthropogenic climate change. the eces, together with other aspects of climate change (e.g., changing cloud cover and aerosols), alter the exposure to uv radiation of humans, plants, animals, and materials to a greater degree than the expected changes in the stratospheric ozone layer—assuming continued and full compliance with the montreal protocol. while our knowledge of the interactive effects of ozone depletion, uv radiation, and climate change has advanced since our last quadrennial assessment, a number of uncertainties persist that limit our ability to precisely and quantitatively assess the full extent and magnitude of these effects. notably, it is uncertain how surface uv radiation will change in the future as the climate continues to change and to what degree the environmental and human effects of climate change are modulated by concurrent changes in stratospheric ozone and uv radiation. these factors are especially important considering future scenarios that might involve solar radiation management and climate intervention [127-130]. despite these uncertainties, it is clear from this quadrennial assessment that the montreal protocol has been vital in protecting humans, aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, air quality, and natural and synthetic materials from the deleterious consequences of stratospheric ozone depletion [131,1]. by protecting the stratospheric ozone layer and mitigating some of the effects of climate change, the montreal protocol continues to contribute to the implementation of the united nations sustainable development goals (sdgs). specifically, the eeap shows the alignment of the montreal protocol and its amendments by addressing 21 targets in 11 of the 17 sdgs (box 2). these sdgs address 28\n",

        "This strategy breaks the document into chunks by moving linearly through the text, combining each sentence with a fixed number of neighboring sentences (the buffer) on either side. It preserves local coherence and is simple to implement, making it effective when important context is typically found nearby. However, it may miss deeper semantic relationships between sentences that aren't adjacent, especially in documents with dispersed or cross-referenced content.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🧠 Anchor-Based Semantic Chunking\n",
        "In this approach, selected anchor sentences serve as the center of each chunk. For each anchor, the system computes semantic similarity with all surrounding sentence groups (pre-computed via the buffer logic) and gathers the most relevant ones, regardless of their original order in the document. This allows the chunk to contain high-context, meaningfully related content even from non-contiguous sections. It results in richer and more focused retrieval, particularly useful in complex documents with interrelated topics.\n"

Exposure to UV-B radiation is generally limited to the surface layer of aquatic ecosystems. This exposure is controlled by factors such as surface warming, inputs of fresh water, surface winds and currents. In the Anthropocene, there is generally more warming and wind, which increases the mixed layer depth, while also sharpening the density barrier to nutrient transport from deep water. Ice melt reduces shielding and freshens the polar ocean, reducing the mixed layer depth. Terrestrial runoff from rain events can lower the transparency to UV-B radiation and warm surface waters due to enhanced absorption of solar radiation. This can result in shallower mixed layers in lakes. Drought would have the opposite effect. UV radiation, combined with anthropogenic factors, exacerbates stress on aquatic ecosystems, especially tropical coral reef ecosystems. Thawing of permafrosts releases UV-absorbing organic carbon into aquatic ecosystems and enhances emissions of carbon dioxide and methane. High UV-B irradiance with heat waves and drought may negatively affect food security and biodiversity, disrupt habitats, and cause bleaching of corals.'"

Climate change alters the depth of the mixed layer in oceans, the thickness of ice cover, the duration of ice-free conditions, and inputs of dissolved organic matter, which can either increase or decrease exposure to UV radiation. In terrestrial ecosystems, UV radiation and climate interact to affect the cycling of nutrients such as carbon and nitrogen, with potential consequences for food security, biodiversity, and climate. Exposure to extreme solar UV radiation can have deleterious effects on many plants, animals, and microorganisms. Changes in stratospheric ozone and climate can also have complex effects on different types of air pollution. Solar UV radiation plays a role in the breakdown of contaminants in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Increased warming can lead to more ice melt and increased exposure of ecosystems to UV radiation. Thawing of permafrosts can result in the release of UV-absorbing organic carbon into aquatic ecosystems and enhanced emissions of carbon dioxide and methane to the atmosphere.\""

        "\n",
        "### 1. Sequential + Buffer Chunking\n",
        "- ✅ Easy to implement\n",
        "- ✅ Maintains local sentence continuity\n",
        "- ❌ Can miss cross-paragraph context\n",
        "- ❌ Chunks may contain filler or loosely related content\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Anchor-Based Semantic Chunking (Proposed)\n",
        "- ✅ Selects the most relevant context per query\n",
        "- ✅ Pulls in semantically similar content even across sections\n",
        "- ✅ Produces tighter, high-signal chunks\n",
        "- ❌ Slightly more computational overhead (semantic similarity matrix) only by a few seconds. It's not that big of a trade off once we get the chunks and create the collection\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🏆 Why the Second One Wins\n",
        "- Better relevance in retrieval: LLM responses based on these chunks are more accurate and grounded\n",
        "- Captures dispersed but related concepts (important in scientific or legal docs)\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🔬 Empirical Observation\n",
        "When tested across questions like \"What are the combined effects of UV radiation and climate?\" or \"How does the Montreal Protocol influence health outcomes?\", the anchor-semantic strategy provided richer and more concise grounding for GPT-4, resulting in clearer and more factually correct answers.\n",
